Subject: [Classpathx-crypto] Primes and BigInteger
Message-ID: <3CBD71FD.95C8D91E@informatik.uni-bonn.de>

Hello!

I've just read that you were wondering about some large primes for which
java.math.BigInteger.isProbablePrime() returns 'false'. Well, BigInteger
has indeed a bug in its primality test. BigInteger runs Miller-Rabin
first. If Miller-Rabin returns 'probable prime' for some number, a
second test will be made, using Lucas this time. And there is a bug in
that Lucas algorithm of BigInteger. I don't know exactly what is is,
because a friend of mine examined several primality test algorithms. He
found that bug in BigInteger and told me. However, it was a very silly
mistake as far as I remeber - something like +1 instead of -1. But the
consequences are enormous - as you have seen.

I hope it will help you.

Bye,
 Marcel

well, i guessed it may be the case and that's why i asked for somebody who
can inspect the sources (of the JDK) to tell me/us more.  thanx for that.

the GNU crypto lib solves this problem by implementing a more reliable and i
think faster primality test based on Colin Plumb's tests (as the info page
states).

by the way, is there a bug number in the bug parade of Sun that points to
this problem?

I've seen no comment on the build system that I put up on the FTP
site.

If no one has objected by next week I'll commit my changes to CVS.


Thanks.


Nic

i'll try it this weekend and will let you know how it fairs on my
W2k+cygwin.
