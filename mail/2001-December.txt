It's really well designed, I like it.

Normally, GNU prefer to use just the HTML 2.0 standard. This ensures that
pages can be read even on text mode browsers like lynx.

I notice you've used DIVs and so on... any chance you could convert these to
something a bit more HTML 2.0?

If you can't I suggest you do this:

- create a directory for crypto on the classpathX website (follow the
example of JAXP).
- subdivide the webpage into separate sections.
- ensure the main crypto index page is HTML 2.0 compliant.

The release will go on the ftp server. If you let me know about when you're
ready to release then I will check out your code and build it (as a final
sanity check) and put it up on the ftp server.

That's why you need a target to produce the tar file (see the gnu coding
standards for info).

Leave it to me.. when we've resolved this HTML version issue I'll put the
link in.


This is all coming together really well! Well done!

You guys have a few pdf files on your site.

Are there free software tools for reading pdfs?

Are there alternatives to pdf files? postscript would be better
because there are free software tools for displaying them.

Of course, info/TeX would be best.

Hi,

I recently grabbed a copy of the code.  No comments yet on
the real guts -- though from the look of it I won't have many
complaints, clean and regular crypto code is usually a very
good sign!  So here's a random set of questions and comments
that came to mind as I skimmed what CVS told me.

Some peripheral points first leaped out at me:

    - Coding style ... three space indents?  No tabs?  And
      Hungarian "IamAnInterface" notation?  Yoiks!  I don't
      like even one of those, sorry.

    - PDFs in the docs.  DocBook XML where possible,
      please.  Though since these are original specs, I suspect
      that's not a real option.  Does CVS need to have those?
      (I hate TexInfo equally ... DocBook at least turns into
      good HTML, though the MathML output may be a
      bit lacking just now.)

    - javadoc.  The links to the PDFs were all broken, and
      there were no "package.html" files to describe why each
      package is there and how to use it.

    - License ... LGPL, not "GPL + library exception".  Maybe
      not an immediate issue, but static linking will increasingly
      matter.

OK, non-peripheral points:  functionality.  Seems to be a strange
selection in this first code drop.

    - Seems that widely used hashes (MD5, SHA1; maybe MD2)
      aren't there.

    - Block ciphers.  Again, common ones are not there yet.
      DES, 3DES-EDE; likely Blowfish; maybe CAST128.

    - And of less immediate concern (to me), stream ciphers.
      ARCFOUR, maybe AES in stream modes, and so on.

    - Looks like the factory always runs selftests on whatever
      it returns. (gnu.crypto.cipher.CipherFactory).  That should
      be conditionalized on a "if doing development" static final
      boolean flag, so it normally doesn't happen.

    - No public key crypto support (RSA, D-H, etc) or digital
      signature support.  Again, why?  The PKCS7 doc there
      strongly suggests it'll be added, along with lots of BER/DER
      style utilities for cert and public/private key management ...

That's just first reactions from a look at the code.  Of course
I like the fact that ciphers are interfaces and there's none of
that silly overhead of a java security layer to slow down calls
past abstract method overhead, so from that perspective the
API framework starts out immediately on the right foot.  And
since secure key storage is a quick hack [NOT!] I can easily
understand adding it later, after some hardware hooks have
been reasonably prototyped.

A lot of that is just wondering what the direction for this code
is expected to be.  I'll assume that what's there is a good start,
but since it doesn't do what I'd first need to be done ... :)

Not having support for today's most widely used cryptographic
algorithms seems to me like it'll be an adoption problem, and I
hope the plan is to make sure that several of those algorithms
get added before the first (beta?) release.

as i mentioned in an earlier message, those documents are published by the

these are in the process of being fixed.  before the existence of a web 
page, the idea was to bundle and include them in the release.  i'm not 
doing this anymore;  instead they will be pointing to the web page.  this 
has the added advantage of making the release smaller in size.

again.  this is being changed 'as-we-speak'.

well;  if you have implementations of them that you'd like to contribute 
then pls ;-)

same thing.

same thing for arc4.  i'm expecting, with the first release to start 
receiving these common algorithms.

unfortunately the implementations i've already done for these are under a 
different license and hence i cannot include them here.  somebody else will 
have to step forward.

noted.  i'd like to open a discussion thread on 'how we can ensure a degree 
of trust in the code'.  the self-test approach is far from being optimal 
and hence i'm looking forward to a fruitful brain-storming exchange.

re. PK algos, the same as above.

re. ASN.1 stuff, i'm already the maintainer/sole-programmer of a 
sourceforge project (cryptix-asn1) that addresses that and is under a 
BSD-like license (see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cryptix-asn1>).  why 
did i mention this?  because all DER related stuff, in gnu.crypto can 
extend/use classes generated by the cryptix-asn1 library.

good to hear :-)

i've done in the past (JNI hooks) to plug native implementations of 
algorithms with the first jce beta with an open-source project, but that 
code never got published.  the justification at the time was that pure java 
code was as fast, and in some instances faster, than using the native 
code.  while this is true if you have a choice between the two, i take your 
point that sometimes you dont.  i will add that to the TODO list.


>A lot of that is just wondering what the direction for this code
>is expected to be.  I'll assume that what's there is a good start,
>but since it doesn't do what I'd first need to be done ... :)

i hoped the README explained where we're going.  this is the start.  the 
next step is to build the adapters that will allow this library to _also_ 
work the jca/jce way hence offering programmers a _choice_.

i'm confident that people/developers will join in, contributing 
implementations of the "every-day" algorithms soon.  in the meantime if you 
and/or others know of the existence of java implementations out there of 
those algorithms with a licence that would allow to re-work them under the 
XGPL i'm happy to do that myself.


>Not having support for today's most widely used cryptographic

my hope is that contributors will come forward _when_ it is released.  i'm 
counting on the "snowball" effect :-)

Ghostscript can read both ps and pdf files. All GNU/Linux system seams
to have it with a handfull of front ends, "gnome-gv" to cite only one.
pdf are a lot smaller that ps, that's at least an advantage also
gzipped postscripts are about the same size as pdf.

I'd like to look at docbook. I've used LaTeX for years but I'd rather
investigate docbook. Do you have any experience with it?
I am quite sure I read somewhere that gcj as some tools to convert
javadoc to texinfo, have you heard of that?

No. The acrobat reader is free as in beer. I meant free-software.

What are the redistribution terms? You may not be able to keep these on the
site, linking to them elsewhere might be ok though.

I have used Docbook, and it is really good.

However, docbook doesn't yet have an info maker and info is still the chosen
doc platform for GNU. There's good reason for that, docbook may be the new
and sexy thing but it still doesn't have the widespread support of info. And
in many ways info is superior (it's lighter for one thing).

The GNU project is working on a javadoc -> info tool. That is being done by
the Classpath Tools project, which is part of Classpath.

Hopefully we will eventually have docbook -> info too, I'm sure someone is
working on it somewhere.

dont know.  i'll have to ask.  if i get the authors' permission i guess i 
can keep them where they are. ok?

the rationale for this is that these things tend to disappear after a time 
from the net and links become forever broken.  they are included here so 
the alert/curious reader/user can verify the code against the designer's 
specifications.

I agree with Dave, but the coding standard is relaxed here at ClasspathX. We
don't force people to use the GNU style (though I might in the future do a
batch update of the CVS with a style enforcer I will do it only with
people's agreement).

I hate hungarian for java code. It just seems dumb to me... but I'm not
prepared to force you guys to change it.

Actually Dave, it's:  "info where possible please".

When there is an info generator for docbook I'll be happy for people to have
their documentation in docbook, until then I meerly tolerate it   /8->

I don't think the PDFs are generated by the project. If they are we must use
something else. We might still have to ditch them and link to them elsewhere
(which seems sensible anyway, if they're someone else's files).

We'll have to think about the "links to PDFs" in light of my comments above.

Absolutely... release early and often...

Having said that the most popular ciphers are the ones that will encourage

I understand your reasons... I'm just nervous of distributing PDF files (a
proprietary format) from non-GNU sources.

I hope you understand.

If you can get the author's permission I will _consider_ allowing their
hosting on the GNU site. If not, we will have to manage the movement of the
files (perhaps by meerly quoting them).

If you're happy to do that it seems to be the best solution.

OK, so I'm a heretic who things "info" should go away in favor
of a much more widely adopted standard, "HTML" ... :)

I guess I'm content to have the PDFs just survive as links
on the web page.  Does that mean they'll move out of the
project CVS?

3 spaces is not so unusual, it does save some precious space if you want
to keep your code within the common 80 columns range. 

As for tabs, space is the lowest common denominator between editors.
The brain dead ones display 8 spaces for TAB!!! and the good ones can 
always be configured to emulate tabs with spaces.
Many projects require "space only" for that reason actually (Apache projects). 
It ensures you'll be able to work on the source no matter how modest 
your system and editor is. Back 6 years ago I used to edit files from 
home with a Minitel (A very cheap text terminal you get with the phone 
in France). It only supported line editing with "ed", those where the days...

And the counter-argument is that "four spaces" is much more common,
doesn't fight against standard 8-space tabstops, and is still "nicer" than
"indent == tab" for cases where nested code constructs "must" be used.

And I'll note that Linux coding style certainly says "indent == tab", and
notes that when that's awkward, the algorithm is the problem, not the
coding standard.  That tends to be very true, in my observation.  Kernel
code, like crypto code, is a domain where "simple is better" normally wins
against the more "deadline oriented" application domains where "done
now is better" wins ... it's "done now" that argues against restructuring
code to get rid of excessive nesting/indentation, and argues for narrow
indents.  (80/4 = max 20 levels/line, 80/3 = 26, either is too complex...)

Not that I want to start such style flamewars ... on the other hand
I think it's completely reasonable to say "three spaces" or "no tabs"
are guidelines that I've never subscribed to.  And I'll criticize them
every time it comes up, particularly when they're added as exceptions
to guidelines that are otherwise largely reasonable, since such style
guidelines do add up to

Displaying 8 spaces for tabstops is not the same as storing them
that way.  Some editors will silently correct spelling "mistakes"
for you too, and store the results.  I don't like either behavior.  In
both cases using a Real Text Editor is a reasonable requirement.

Think of tabs as an 8-to-1 compression scheme built in to the
standard text file format.


> Many projects require "space only" for that reason actually (Apache projects). 

The original motivation I heard for that was that a number of
early contributors didn't want to switch from Win32 editors which,
to this day, are often unable to handle tabbing correctly.
(MSFT discourages widespread use of monospaced fonts
and "ASCII art" tools.  Never mind that interop with other
operating systems gets worse that way.)

Many non-Apache projects still expect that Real Text Editors
will be used ... which know how to handle tabs! :)

Just to let you know: I am working on this issue. I've been busy with
work (last week at my old contract, new contract this week!) and I
haven't had much time.

However, I did solve the central portability problem of my original
makefile: the path separator used (I had hard coded ':').

I've solved it by using a functional system (the GNU Make @(call)
construct allows a certain amount of functionalism).

It strikes me that if I solve the $(wildcard) problem then I won't
have to use the shell script trick and that might mean that a native
windows make might work.

I'm still working on it... I'll try and get it done this week... I'm
really sorry for the delay.


If you guys want to go ahead with an ANT based release then let me
know.

we use a trick (see the Makefile.in), where we do:

(line #119):

# a workaround to allow using the same Makefile under both Unix and NT
ifeq (${OS},Windows_NT)
         PS:=;
else
         PS:=:
endif

and then use ${PS} everywhere we need to separate path-elements.

i'd suggest we do a release with ANT if we're going to standardise on ANT 
in classpathx projects.  if not, i'd rather wait and have a common 'way' 
for building; ie. make with ANT as an alternative.

if any other project/team-leader is willing to adopt ANT, i'm happy to help 
so we can harmonise the use of ANT across multiple projects.

Yes. I've fixed that by using this functional system.

I'd rather not dictate the use ANT across the board... if we move to that
gradually that would be fine. I still prefer Autoconf/Make because that is
the GNU standard and because it handles native code better... given the
importance of GCJ in the "strategy" native code may become important.

Having said that I think ANT will become important as it matures and more
java programmers come to GNU from other environments.

Autoconf seems to take care of that. This is the code generated in the 
configure script:

# Rewrite early, but we need PATH_SEPARATOR.
# The user is always right.
if test "${PATH_SEPARATOR+set}" != set; then
  echo "#! $SHELL" >conftest.sh
  echo  "exit 0"   >>conftest.sh
  chmod +x conftest.sh
  if (PATH=".;."; conftest.sh) >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    PATH_SEPARATOR=';'
  else
    PATH_SEPARATOR=:
  fi
  rm -f conftest.sh
fi


I rely on this in my autoconf/automake example for gnu-crypto.
However...
apparantly it doesn't work on cygwin. I suspect it is because I also
have to add double quotes all over the place, something like:

   jikes -classpath "pkg1@PS@pkg2" ...

to prevent the shell from resolving the semicolon as the "end of
command" character. It used to work on cygwin but I haven't try it for
few weeks.


However going back to the earlier Makefile discussion, I've cut and paste 
portions of the make process generated by automake/autoconf scripts for 
GCJ compilation and shared libraries. As you can see, it is not exactly 
trivial or intuitive. 
Do you really want to reinvent all of that while automake, a GNU tool 
Copyrighted by the FSF, is out there?

The trouble is automake (the version that widely installed) has some
issues... my bodged makefile is not actually that much work and therefore
I don't mind maintaining it until automake becomes a realistic option.

I wouldn't object to any project using automake as long as they maintain
it themselves.

But on the other hand my bodge makefile does the job (or can do the job)
quite well.
