hi there everybody,

after so many weeks, we're finally here :-)  thanks to Nic Ferrier for his 
hospitality, and for doing everything needed to make it happen.


i've already checked in the initial copy of the project.  it compiles --of 
course ;-) -- and have added a new tree structure (source/test) that 
includes junit tests.  few notes before i go further:

* the name src/ has been changed to source/ to align with the customs of 
the umbrella project; ie. classpathx.  i've changed the references in the 
build.xml file to use a symbolic name ${src.dir} so it's easier if in the 
future the source directory naming changes.

* the names under test/ mirror that under gnu/crypto/ .  in other words, 
package gnu.crypto.foo will have its test classes in test/foo.  from 
experience this proves to be easy when (a) compiling, jarring the main 
deliverables, and (b) separating the 'main' code from its 'test' counterpart.

some people argue that this separation disallows testing package private 
methods.  true; but (a) junit is not made for that, and (b) if an internal 
function is wrong then it will impact the result of a visible/public 
one.  write enough test cases to ensure the fullfilment of the contract for 
the visible one and the weaknesses/bugs of the internal ones will 
appear  --at least that's what i do.

if somebody has other opinions/experience, pls share them.


things left to do/solve before a first public release:

1. fix the links in the Javadoc for the reference documentation of the 
implemented algorithms.  i was referencing a .zip file but when i checked 
in the project i only checked in the .pdf and .txt files that are included 
in those archives.  i also moved the JavaStyle and AntStyle documents to 
the docs/ folder.

2. fix in the build.xml, in the docs section, the reference to the project 
home page --i still have to find that out from Nic before this can be done.

3. write an index.html page that will act as the root of all the project's 
documentation.  this should mirror the README at the project's root.

4. debugging: the code still contains in-line debugging statements that can 
be turned on/off.  it uses conditional compilation, so it's only useful for 
"programmers" and it requires re-compilation before the debugging output 
can occur.  i dont like it as part of a released code.  yes it's useful and 
necessary while you're getting the implementation to do what it's supposed 
to do, but for release it's ugly and confusing.  i would like to remove it 
unless somebody can convince me otherwise.

5. code correctness: each algorithm is published with its test vectors.  an 
implementation is deemed correct if it generates equivalent test vectors to 
those published by the designer of the algorithm.  the junit tests attempt 
to test the implementations against a very small subset of those test 
vectors.  is that enough?  i should note that the tools under 
gnu.crypto.tools do generate the test vectors (at least for the 
gnu.crypto.cipher package) in NESSIE and (almost) NIST forms.  yet the 
verification of the result is not straightforward:

* either the gnu.crypto.tool tools generate a more or less exact match of 
the published test vectors and then a diff tool is run over these two files 
to detect eventual differences, or
* we write a new tool that would read a published test vector file and try 
to generated the same from the implementation and compare the results 
--something that would automate the process of verifying an implementation 
basically.

6. deliverables: what should our deliverables consist of? separate archives 
for source, binaries, documentation? combine the lot? should we include the 
designers' reference documentation? their test vectors?  have a look at the 
sizes of these files before giving an answer please.

7. versioning: what type of versioning should we use?


things to do later:

this is still an open issue, and i would leave that for everybody to 
suggest what they can do relative to the time they can spend working on 
this project.


cheers;
rsn

Dear Friends & Future Millionaire:


Invest in technology that will make you money.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
Are you making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from 
your home?  A one time investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars 
get's you on the road to financial success.
ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE 
INTERNET !
 

===========================================
BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to 
the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly 
news program recently devoted an entire show to the 
investigation of this program described below, to see if it 
really can make people money. The show also investigated 
whether or not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are 
''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the 
program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they 
are bound to make some mega bucks with only$25 out of 
pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM
HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable 
opportunity. I was approached many times before but each 
time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see 
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and 
money required. To my astonishment, I received a total of 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

============================================

Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around 
for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I 
received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on 
it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks 
later the money started to come in. First month I only made 
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it 
again. The key to success in this program is to follow the 
simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials 
later but first,

=PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE=

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 
months easily and comfortably, please read the 
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, 
GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER 
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL
ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT 
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER
in case of any mail problems.

=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of 
the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports so that you can save 
them on your  computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL 
COST $5 X 5=$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your 
computer so they  will be accessible for you to send to the 
1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a 
floppy of these reports and keep them on your desk in case 
something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who 
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in 
any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 
through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. 
Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! 
People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all 
five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not 
work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and 
then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything
other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this 
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the 
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the 
cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO 
REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO 
REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO 
REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO 
REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 
Position.
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & 
address ACCURATELY!

============================================

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, 
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER 
CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. 
To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 
5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable 
marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-
mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads 
and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY

============================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, 
and we will assume You and those involved send out only 
5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing receive 
only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but 
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out 
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-
mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 
1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail 
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 
0.2% responded with orders. 
That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 
500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for 
Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 
orders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-
mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 
0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report  # 5.
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 
(half million).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 
3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND 
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND 
NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL 
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
 
============================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 
PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or 
half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the 
Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people 
will do just that, and more!

METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING 
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

============================================

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads 
on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly 
suggest you start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you 
go along. 

For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail 
them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same 
day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail 
they send out, with your name and address on it, will be 
prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the 
report.

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ============

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME 
ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for 
each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at 
least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write 
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal 
address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that 
you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If 
you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you 
do.

=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 
2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working 
for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS 
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are 
placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK 
of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are 
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND 
START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO 
LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!!

============================================

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF 
THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that 
can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with 
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can 
make more money in the next few weeks and months than you 
have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS 
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you 
have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved 
others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people 
you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and 
your name will be on every one of them.

Remember though, the more you send out the more potential 
customer you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the 
ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become 
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

======== MORE TESTIMONIALS ============ 

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I 
am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled 
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole 
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and 
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally 
ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she 
jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was 
ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't 
work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was
shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
Mitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois

==========================================

''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to 
make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative 
that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that 
there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''. '' I  was surprised when I found my 
medium size post office box  crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this 
deal is that it does not matter where  people live. There simply 
isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big." Dan 
Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

===========================================

''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no 
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I 
was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed 
then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came 
within 22 weeks." Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.

============================================

''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money 
with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions 

carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My 
first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month 
my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks 
to the internet.". Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

It's really well designed, I like it.

Normally, GNU prefer to use just the HTML 2.0 standard. This ensures that
pages can be read even on text mode browsers like lynx.

I notice you've used DIVs and so on... any chance you could convert these to
something a bit more HTML 2.0?

If you can't I suggest you do this:

- create a directory for crypto on the classpathX website (follow the
example of JAXP).
- subdivide the webpage into separate sections.
- ensure the main crypto index page is HTML 2.0 compliant.

The release will go on the ftp server. If you let me know about when you're
ready to release then I will check out your code and build it (as a final
sanity check) and put it up on the ftp server.

That's why you need a target to produce the tar file (see the gnu coding
standards for info).

Leave it to me.. when we've resolved this HTML version issue I'll put the
link in.


This is all coming together really well! Well done!

You guys have a few pdf files on your site.

Are there free software tools for reading pdfs?

Are there alternatives to pdf files? postscript would be better
because there are free software tools for displaying them.

Of course, info/TeX would be best.

Hi,

I recently grabbed a copy of the code.  No comments yet on
the real guts -- though from the look of it I won't have many
complaints, clean and regular crypto code is usually a very
good sign!  So here's a random set of questions and comments
that came to mind as I skimmed what CVS told me.

Some peripheral points first leaped out at me:

    - Coding style ... three space indents?  No tabs?  And
      Hungarian "IamAnInterface" notation?  Yoiks!  I don't
      like even one of those, sorry.

    - PDFs in the docs.  DocBook XML where possible,
      please.  Though since these are original specs, I suspect
      that's not a real option.  Does CVS need to have those?
      (I hate TexInfo equally ... DocBook at least turns into
      good HTML, though the MathML output may be a
      bit lacking just now.)

    - javadoc.  The links to the PDFs were all broken, and
      there were no "package.html" files to describe why each
      package is there and how to use it.

    - License ... LGPL, not "GPL + library exception".  Maybe
      not an immediate issue, but static linking will increasingly
      matter.

OK, non-peripheral points:  functionality.  Seems to be a strange
selection in this first code drop.

    - Seems that widely used hashes (MD5, SHA1; maybe MD2)
      aren't there.

    - Block ciphers.  Again, common ones are not there yet.
      DES, 3DES-EDE; likely Blowfish; maybe CAST128.

    - And of less immediate concern (to me), stream ciphers.
      ARCFOUR, maybe AES in stream modes, and so on.

    - Looks like the factory always runs selftests on whatever
      it returns. (gnu.crypto.cipher.CipherFactory).  That should
      be conditionalized on a "if doing development" static final
      boolean flag, so it normally doesn't happen.

    - No public key crypto support (RSA, D-H, etc) or digital
      signature support.  Again, why?  The PKCS7 doc there
      strongly suggests it'll be added, along with lots of BER/DER
      style utilities for cert and public/private key management ...

That's just first reactions from a look at the code.  Of course
I like the fact that ciphers are interfaces and there's none of
that silly overhead of a java security layer to slow down calls
past abstract method overhead, so from that perspective the
API framework starts out immediately on the right foot.  And
since secure key storage is a quick hack [NOT!] I can easily
understand adding it later, after some hardware hooks have
been reasonably prototyped.

A lot of that is just wondering what the direction for this code
is expected to be.  I'll assume that what's there is a good start,
but since it doesn't do what I'd first need to be done ... :)

Not having support for today's most widely used cryptographic
algorithms seems to me like it'll be an adoption problem, and I
hope the plan is to make sure that several of those algorithms
get added before the first (beta?) release.

- Dave

p.s. I'm not currently subscribed to the list, so please cc me

of course.

today we're using/publishing in html.  is that ok?

as i mentioned in an earlier message, those documents are published by the 
designers not us.

these are in the process of being fixed.  before the existence of a web 
page, the idea was to bundle and include them in the release.  i'm not 
doing this anymore;  instead they will be pointing to the web page.  this 
has the added advantage of making the release smaller in size.

again.  this is being changed 'as-we-speak'.

well;  if you have implementations of them that you'd like to contribute 
then pls ;-)

same thing.

same thing for arc4.  i'm expecting, with the first release to start 
receiving these common algorithms.

unfortunately the implementations i've already done for these are under a 
different license and hence i cannot include them here.  somebody else will 
have to step forward.

noted.  i'd like to open a discussion thread on 'how we can ensure a degree 
of trust in the code'.  the self-test approach is far from being optimal 
and hence i'm looking forward to a fruitful brain-storming exchange.

re. PK algos, the same as above.

re. ASN.1 stuff, i'm already the maintainer/sole-programmer of a 
sourceforge project (cryptix-asn1) that addresses that and is under a 
BSD-like license (see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cryptix-asn1>).  why 
did i mention this?  because all DER related stuff, in gnu.crypto can 
extend/use classes generated by the cryptix-asn1 library.

good to hear :-)

i've done in the past (JNI hooks) to plug native implementations of 
algorithms with the first jce beta with an open-source project, but that 
code never got published.  the justification at the time was that pure java 
code was as fast, and in some instances faster, than using the native 
code.  while this is true if you have a choice between the two, i take your 
point that sometimes you dont.  i will add that to the TODO list.


>A lot of that is just wondering what the direction for this code
>is expected to be.  I'll assume that what's there is a good start,
>but since it doesn't do what I'd first need to be done ... :)

i hoped the README explained where we're going.  this is the start.  the 
next step is to build the adapters that will allow this library to _also_ 
work the jca/jce way hence offering programmers a _choice_.

i'm confident that people/developers will join in, contributing 
implementations of the "every-day" algorithms soon.  in the meantime if you 
and/or others know of the existence of java implementations out there of 
those algorithms with a licence that would allow to re-work them under the 
XGPL i'm happy to do that myself.


>Not having support for today's most widely used cryptographic
>algorithms seems to me like it'll be an adoption problem, and I
>hope the plan is to make sure that several of those algorithms
>get added before the first (beta?) release.

my hope is that contributors will come forward _when_ it is released.  i'm 
counting on the "snowball" effect :-)

Ghostscript can read both ps and pdf files. All GNU/Linux system seams
to have it with a handfull of front ends, "gnome-gv" to cite only one.
pdf are a lot smaller that ps, that's at least an advantage also
gzipped postscripts are about the same size as pdf.

I'd like to look at docbook. I've used LaTeX for years but I'd rather
investigate docbook. Do you have any experience with it?
I am quite sure I read somewhere that gcj as some tools to convert
javadoc to texinfo, have you heard of that?

No. The acrobat reader is free as in beer. I meant free-software.

What are the redistribution terms? You may not be able to keep these on the
site, linking to them elsewhere might be ok though.

I have used Docbook, and it is really good.

However, docbook doesn't yet have an info maker and info is still the chosen
doc platform for GNU. There's good reason for that, docbook may be the new
and sexy thing but it still doesn't have the widespread support of info. And
in many ways info is superior (it's lighter for one thing).

The GNU project is working on a javadoc -> info tool. That is being done by
the Classpath Tools project, which is part of Classpath.

Hopefully we will eventually have docbook -> info too, I'm sure someone is
working on it somewhere.

dont know.  i'll have to ask.  if i get the authors' permission i guess i 
can keep them where they are. ok?

the rationale for this is that these things tend to disappear after a time 
from the net and links become forever broken.  they are included here so 
the alert/curious reader/user can verify the code against the designer's 
specifications.

I agree with Dave, but the coding standard is relaxed here at ClasspathX. We
don't force people to use the GNU style (though I might in the future do a
batch update of the CVS with a style enforcer I will do it only with
people's agreement).

I hate hungarian for java code. It just seems dumb to me... but I'm not
prepared to force you guys to change it.

Actually Dave, it's:  "info where possible please".

When there is an info generator for docbook I'll be happy for people to have
their documentation in docbook, until then I meerly tolerate it   /8->

I don't think the PDFs are generated by the project. If they are we must use
something else. We might still have to ditch them and link to them elsewhere
(which seems sensible anyway, if they're someone else's files).

We'll have to think about the "links to PDFs" in light of my comments above.

Absolutely... release early and often...

I understand your reasons... I'm just nervous of distributing PDF files (a
proprietary format) from non-GNU sources.

I hope you understand.

If you can get the author's permission I will _consider_ allowing their
hosting on the GNU site. If not, we will have to manage the movement of the
files (perhaps by meerly quoting them).

OK, so I'm a heretic who things "info" should go away in favor
of a much more widely adopted standard, "HTML" ... :)

I guess I'm content to have the PDFs just survive as links
on the web page.  Does that mean they'll move out of the
project CVS?

3 spaces is not so unusual, it does save some precious space if you want
to keep your code within the common 80 columns range. 

As for tabs, space is the lowest common denominator between editors.
The brain dead ones display 8 spaces for TAB!!! and the good ones can 
always be configured to emulate tabs with spaces.
Many projects require "space only" for that reason actually (Apache projects). 
It ensures you'll be able to work on the source no matter how modest 
your system and editor is. Back 6 years ago I used to edit files from 
home with a Minitel (A very cheap text terminal you get with the phone 
in France). It only supported line editing with "ed", those where the days...

And the counter-argument is that "four spaces" is much more common,
doesn't fight against standard 8-space tabstops, and is still "nicer" than
"indent == tab" for cases where nested code constructs "must" be used.

And I'll note that Linux coding style certainly says "indent == tab", and
notes that when that's awkward, the algorithm is the problem, not the
coding standard.  That tends to be very true, in my observation.  Kernel
code, like crypto code, is a domain where "simple is better" normally wins
against the more "deadline oriented" application domains where "done
now is better" wins ... it's "done now" that argues against restructuring
code to get rid of excessive nesting/indentation, and argues for narrow
indents.  (80/4 = max 20 levels/line, 80/3 = 26, either is too complex...)

Not that I want to start such style flamewars ... on the other hand
I think it's completely reasonable to say "three spaces" or "no tabs"
are guidelines that I've never subscribed to.  And I'll criticize them
every time it comes up, particularly when they're added as exceptions
to guidelines that are otherwise largely reasonable, since such style
guidelines do add up to

Displaying 8 spaces for tabstops is not the same as storing them
that way.  Some editors will silently correct spelling "mistakes"
for you too, and store the results.  I don't like either behavior.  In
both cases using a Real Text Editor is a reasonable requirement.

Think of tabs as an 8-to-1 compression scheme built in to the
standard text file format.


> Many projects require "space only" for that reason actually (Apache projects). 

The original motivation I heard for that was that a number of
early contributors didn't want to switch from Win32 editors which,
to this day, are often unable to handle tabbing correctly.
(MSFT discourages widespread use of monospaced fonts
and "ASCII art" tools.  Never mind that interop with other
operating systems gets worse that way.)

Many non-Apache projects still expect that Real Text Editors
will be used ... which know how to handle tabs! :)

Just to let you know: I am working on this issue. I've been busy with
work (last week at my old contract, new contract this week!) and I
haven't had much time.

However, I did solve the central portability problem of my original
makefile: the path separator used (I had hard coded ':').

I've solved it by using a functional system (the GNU Make @(call)
construct allows a certain amount of functionalism).

It strikes me that if I solve the $(wildcard) problem then I won't
have to use the shell script trick and that might mean that a native
windows make might work.

I'm still working on it... I'll try and get it done this week... I'm
really sorry for the delay.


If you guys want to go ahead with an ANT based release then let me
know.

we use a trick (see the Makefile.in), where we do:

(line #119):

# a workaround to allow using the same Makefile under both Unix and NT
ifeq (${OS},Windows_NT)
         PS:=;
else
         PS:=:
endif

and then use ${PS} everywhere we need to separate path-elements.

i'd suggest we do a release with ANT if we're going to standardise on ANT 
in classpathx projects.  if not, i'd rather wait and have a common 'way' 
for building; ie. make with ANT as an alternative.

if any other project/team-leader is willing to adopt ANT, i'm happy to help 
so we can harmonise the use of ANT across multiple projects.

Yes. I've fixed that by using this functional system.

I'd rather not dictate the use ANT across the board... if we move to that
gradually that would be fine. I still prefer Autoconf/Make because that is
the GNU standard and because it handles native code better... given the
importance of GCJ in the "strategy" native code may become important.

Having said that I think ANT will become important as it matures and more
java programmers come to GNU from other environments.

Autoconf seems to take care of that. This is the code generated in the 
configure script:

# Rewrite early, but we need PATH_SEPARATOR.
# The user is always right.
if test "${PATH_SEPARATOR+set}" != set; then
  echo "#! $SHELL" >conftest.sh
  echo  "exit 0"   >>conftest.sh
  chmod +x conftest.sh
  if (PATH=".;."; conftest.sh) >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    PATH_SEPARATOR=';'
  else
    PATH_SEPARATOR=:
  fi
  rm -f conftest.sh
fi


I rely on this in my autoconf/automake example for gnu-crypto.
However...
apparantly it doesn't work on cygwin. I suspect it is because I also
have to add double quotes all over the place, something like:

   jikes -classpath "pkg1@PS@pkg2" ...

to prevent the shell from resolving the semicolon as the "end of
command" character. It used to work on cygwin but I haven't try it for
few weeks.


However going back to the earlier Makefile discussion, I've cut and paste 
portions of the make process generated by automake/autoconf scripts for 
GCJ compilation and shared libraries. As you can see, it is not exactly 
trivial or intuitive. 
Do you really want to reinvent all of that while automake, a GNU tool 
Copyrighted by the FSF, is out there?

The trouble is automake (the version that widely installed) has some
issues... my bodged makefile is not actually that much work and therefore
I don't mind maintaining it until automake becomes a realistic option.

I wouldn't object to any project using automake as long as they maintain
it themselves.

But on the other hand my bodge makefile does the job (or can do the job)
quite well.

Gentlemen,

while implementing this scheme in Java, i found an inconsistency in the 
specification of the EMSA-PSS-Decode(M, EM, emBits) primitive (document B 
of your submission, page 11), at step #10.

this should read "...or if the octet at position emLen -hLen -sLen -2 is 
not equal to 01..." and not "...emLen -hLen -sLen -1."


cheers;

Hi Raif,

I think the inconsistency lies in how you define the leftmost position of an
octet string; this could be either "position 0" (as in C and Java) or
"position 1". We have adopted the second convention; the octet on position n
is the nth leftmost octet rather than the (n+1)st leftmost octet. The length
of the PS string preceding the 01 octet is emLen-hLen-sLen-2, so the 01
octet is on position emLen-hLen-sLen-1.

Yet, I admit that this convention should have been explicitly stated in the
document.

Best regards,
Jakob Jonsson

yes. it definitely makes sense.  i was in "java mode" too deep to see 
another explanation.

thanks for taking the time to respond.

FYI, the soon to be released GNU library will include a full implementation 
of the RSA-PSS scheme with spport for both SHA and RIPEMD160 as underlying 
hash functions for the MGF.

hi guys,

please have a look at <http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/crypto/> 
which describes the cointents of the library as of yesterday and tell me 
what you think.

i'd like to have a release done before the next weekend, if possible, even 
if this means doing it with ANT tool only.


cheers;
rsn

      Are you developing Java applications using Swing, AWT and =
servlets/JSP?
      Companies that develop Java applications today must choose between =
making a GUI front end using AWT/Swing or HTML front end using servlets =
and JSP. Either choice has advantages and disadvantages, but it is clear =
that the ideal solution would support both. However, because these =
technologies are very different in their nature, only one can be =
typically implemented in a finished application. There is a large market =
for GUI based Java applications but these are running into speed and =
compatibility problems. Also, applets executed within browsers cannot =
take advantage of the latest Swing controls and features. Taken =
together, these issues prevent companies from developing GUI as they =
should be able to do. WebCream solves these problems without programmers =
having to learn any APIs and without any modification to existing forms. =

      WebCream 4.0 is here and you have to see it to believe it!
      WebCream is a unique tool for Java, that provides automated =
web-enabling for GUI based Java applications and applets. WebCream =
allows developers to implement a GUI front end using AWT and Swing, and =
at the same time automatically get HTML access to the application. In a =
way, WebCream can be thought of as a dynamic Java to HTML converter, =
that converts Java frames and dialogs to HTML on the fly. It then =
emulates web page actions as GUI events to retain application original =
logic. WebCream is unique in that it requires no modifications to =
existing forms and business logic, and does not require programmers to =
learn any APIs. It is designed to publish existing applications and =
applets, it's just a matter of setting up your web server and a property =
file describing the application. The rest is handled by WebCream. To see =
a demonstration of WebCream live, check out our Demos page.=20

Hello!

I've just read that you were wondering about some large primes for which
java.math.BigInteger.isProbablePrime() returns 'false'. Well, BigInteger
has indeed a bug in its primality test. BigInteger runs Miller-Rabin
first. If Miller-Rabin returns 'probable prime' for some number, a
second test will be made, using Lucas this time. And there is a bug in
that Lucas algorithm of BigInteger. I don't know exactly what is is,
because a friend of mine examined several primality test algorithms. He
found that bug in BigInteger and told me. However, it was a very silly
mistake as far as I remeber - something like +1 instead of -1. But the
consequences are enormous - as you have seen.

I hope it will help you.

Bye,
 Marcel

well, i guessed it may be the case and that's why i asked for somebody who
can inspect the sources (of the JDK) to tell me/us more.  thanx for that.

the GNU crypto lib solves this problem by implementing a more reliable and i
think faster primality test based on Colin Plumb's tests (as the info page
states).

by the way, is there a bug number in the bug parade of Sun that points to
this problem?

I've seen no comment on the build system that I put up on the FTP
site.

If no one has objected by next week I'll commit my changes to CVS.


Thanks.

Hello,

I've been doing some studying in cryptography, came across GNU classpathx,
and have been working on implementing some ciphers using the crypto API.

The patch which follows (which is longish, but I didn't want to do an
attachment---please admonish if this is poor etiquette) is an
implementation of Serpent which appears correct in a few tests. It does
not, as far as I know, refer to any non-free techniques---is uses some
optimized S-box functions found by Dag Arne Osvik which are implemented
in a GPL'd ADA implementation from http://www.ii.uib.no/~gisle/serpent.html.

The patch is based on a recent CVS checkout and updates the gcj
Makefile.{in,am}, the classes Registry and CipherFactory, and adds the
Serpent class itself. Classpathx is welcome to use it.

Cheers,

+ * Serpent is a 32-round substitution-permutation network block cipher,
+ * operating on 128-bit blocks and accepting keys of 128, 192, and 256
+ * bits in length. At each round the plaintext is XORed with a 128 bit
+ * portion of the session key -- a 4224 bit key computed from the input
+ * key -- then one of eight S-boxes are applied, and finally a simple
+ * linear transformation is done. Decryption does the exact same thing
+ * in reverse order, and using the eight inverses of the S-boxes.
+ * <p>
+ * Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen as
+ * a proposed cipher for the Advanced Encryption Standard.
+ * <p>
+ * Reference: <a
+ * href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html">Serpent: A
+ * Candidate Block Cipher for the Advanced Encryption Standard.</a>
+ * <p>
+ * Serpent can be sped up greatly by replacing S-box substitution with a
+ * sequence of binary operations, and the optimal implementation depends
+ * upon finding the fastest sequence of binary operations that reproduce
+ * this substitution. This implementation uses the S-boxes discovered by
+ * <a href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~osvik/">Dag Arne Osvik</a>, which are
+ * optimized for the Pentium family of processors.

thanks a bunch for your contribution :-)

we dont have an established etiquette for contributions in this project,
besides the coding style :-) but i'm sure we'll come up with something
intelligent as we go.

i'll add the patches during this weekend, along with some classes and
algorithms i've been working on (HMAC, UMAC, etc...).


btw, do you have (access to) the test vectors for Serpent?  we should have a
junit test case to exercise and produce/compare some of the test vectors for
every algorithm so as to certify correctness (e.g.
source/test/cipher/TestOfSquare).

thanks again for your contribution + cheers;

Earlier today I generated some KAT and Monte-Carlo test vectors and
compared them to those included in the Serpent team's AES submission.
The implementation appears correct (at least, my faith in it is a bit
stronger). I'll see about putting together a test case for it, however.

Also, a question: it appears as though the library is working with the
assumption that all of its ciphers are not stateful, ie something like:

	cipher.encryptBlock(pt, 0, ct, 0);
	cipher.decryptBlock(ct, 0, cpt, 0);

will result in pt==cpt (and this is the case, I think, with all the
current cipher algorithms, as well as most others that I'm familiar with).
This isn't strictly true, for example, for ARCFOUR, whose s-boxes evolve
over time. So would stateful ciphers need to be careful about this (e.g.
keeping s-boxes for encryption and decryption), or could one assume that
this is not, in practice, the case?

(Bonus: yes, ARCFOUR is a stream cipher, so would a seperate interface
(IStreamCipher) be a solution?)

Cheers,

this is always true with symmetric key block ciphers.

the thing to clarify here is that:

a. both types of ciphers are stateful, yet
b. one type (the symmetric-key block-ciphers eg. aes, rijndael, serpent, and
all gnu.crypto.cipher classes) is invertible, while the other (not yet
implemented in gnu.crypto) is not.

yes! as far as i know, it's the only solution.

for other types of stream ciphers, have a look at some newly designed stream
ciphers, submitted in the NESSIE project --see
https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/nessie/workshop/submissions.html.

As promised, attached is a pared-down version of a test suite for
Serpent. It runs all the variable-key and variable-text known-answer
tests, and the first ten of each of the monte carlo tests provided in
the Serpent team's submission. It also runs the BaseCipher's default
symmetry test.

This version comes from a test suite that tests all known-answer and all
monte carlo tests -- which seemed a bit excessive. It is available at:

	http://www.metastatic.org/src/serpent-test-full.tar.gz

It is 117 kilobytes compressed, and is slow.

I figured that this version provided a good enough compromise, and can be
trimmed even further by simply deleting answers from the bottoms of the
test arrays.

If GNU's mailing lists (or you) do not like attachments, the trimmed
version can also be found at:

	http://www.metastatic.org/src/serpent-test.tar.gz

that's simply beautiful.  i think all cipher test cases should follow 
this model.

is this the inverse of the NistKAT and NistMCT (in gnu.crypto.tools) tools?

since we will be using code from these tools for the test cases, should 
we look into re-factoring that code to improve code re-usability across 
the library?

i've committed to the cvs in the last few days the following:

1. Casey Marshall's contribution of Serpent and its test case;

2. a new package gnu.crypto.mac that includes:

* HMAC implementation that allows constructing the HMAC over all 
implemented (now and in the future) hash algorithms (in gnu.crypto.hash),

* UMac32 and UHash32 as described in Krovetz & al. submission to the 
NESSIE --which is also an IETF draft,

3. OFB block cipher mode of operations as described in NIST's 
recommendations;

4. a new UMacGenerator pseudo-random number generator, described in 
Krovetz & al. paper using the AES;

5. updated the home page to reflect the new additions;

6. added Casey to the list of AUTHORS;

7. updated the GNU build-related files in the top level as well as in 
gcj/ and gcj/source --i finally was able to run aclocal, autoconf and 
automake using the cygwin distribution.  pls note that automake (on my 
cygwin installation is 1.6.1 which required me to change some of the 
files that were failing cause were relying on version 1.6a.  if this 
causes others build envs to break, then raise your hand.

8. removed some NIST MCT test cases for Anubis with key sizes > 256.

9. removed superfluous characters from some source files that were 
causing some interpreters to barf.

things remaining for the first public release are:

* an implementation of the UST (David McGrew's IETF draft),
* re-visiting of the test hierarchy and -may be- re-factoring of some 
gnu.crypto.tool classes,
* consensus on the effectiveness of both ANT and GNU build-related tools.


cheers;

Did you look at the automakejar stuff? It has been recieved with
enthusiasm on other GNU java projects and hopefully will become
something of a standard for us.

I put an example tar in the classpathx ftp dir.

After a fashion, yes.

It did not even occur to me to use that code; I like this idea, however
--- one could envision a point where writing a full-conformance test for
a particular algorithm would amount to simply including the appropriate
test vectors and pointing the program at them. It seems smarter than
keeping large, static String arrays.

absolutely.  Nistxxx tools _emit_ the test vectors, but they also 
include the code to verify the inverse operation of what they generate.

re-factoring that code and re-using your patterns (from TestOfSerpent) 
would allow:

a. ending up with new tools (or added functionality to the existing 
ones) that _read_ the conformance test vectors and verify them, this 
time instead of _writing_ them out.

b. exposing some methods in these tools, or have'em all use common 
Helper(s) to do their job and making writing TestOf<block-ciphers> as 
simple as feeding the test-case a collection of files (or a directory 
where those files would be found).


does this make sense?

Hello,

I had written an implementation of MD4 for another project (now undergoing
a complete rewrite) and have reworked it into more of a GNU style than JCE
style (the program didn't need anything except MD4 -- and an incorrect
version at that -- so genericity seemed useless). It was quite easy to make
a patch for Classpathx.

Classpathx is welcome to incorporate it, if you like (I know MD4 is not
used as much as other algorithms). The patch (gzipped) is attached.

Raif,

I have checkout the latest and noticed that all shell scripts and
Makefiles have the DOS end-of-line character sequence (with the extra
^M).

As a result, all the gcj tool chain was broken on Unix!
I have fixed all the files under crypto/gcj and also changed few
exe permissions for the shell scripts.
For some of the files I had to remove them from CVS altogether and re-import.

It should be working again now. 
Next time you checkout, I recommend to remove the gcj directory and 
checkout a fresh copy. Some CVS clients don't pick up the difference
between Unix and DOS ending and fail to update files correspondingly.



It is VERY important that all shell scripts and Makefiles use the Unix
ending otherwise they won't work under Unix platforms (only Cygwin
quietly filters the extra ^M)..

In fact, it would propably be better if ALL the source code had the Unix
ending, as the Primary target of the gnu project is GNU / Unix systems
rather than Windows platforms.

Olivier

PS: I'll start working on the JUnit test harness for GCJ soonish.

It would certainly make life easier. However, Raif does not have a
GNU system available to him, if someone donated one, I'm sure he'd
use it.

In the mean time he's doing excellent work contributing to the
ClasspathX project.

yes you're right; i just checked them with (gVIM + Cream) --which i 
should have done instead of using that "intelligent" expensive IDE (you 
know what i'm talking about!).

i'll try to remember doing that every time i touch these files.

if you check the java sources, you'll notive that this is the case.  i 
think the tool i use wants to be too smart when it comes to (what i 
considers) plain text files.

Ooops! I am not sure if I sounded aggressive! That was not the
intention. I am very sorry, if it is the case.

One thing that is good, the cvs diff at savanah does pick up the
difference for modified files. That is if you change the content of a file
and also convert it to unix ending, the file will be fully updated.
Strangely enought, it does not work if the only change is a convertion to
Unix ending!

I did open a few files in the test package while working on the JUnit
compilation. Some are actually a mix up of DOS and Unix ending (most
lines with DOS ending, few with Unix).
Anyway, it does not seem to matter much for the java sources, shell
scripts and makefiles are more critical.

It does work! I ran the test suite, it reports:

101 tests, 13 failures.

The failures are not really failures, they all seem to boil down to
java.security.Exception from requests for algorithms not available in the
gcj standard lib (as opposed to jdk).

I need to work more on the makefile before I am ready to commit the
update.

Oli

the current codebase --with the gnu.crypto.jce package, which consists 
of adapters for use by the JCA/JCE-- runs fine using sun's java 
interpreter; i.e. all tests pass.  with that package, the gnu.crypto 
implements the MD5, SHA-1 (hash) and DSS (signature) that are standard 
jdk (without the need for any JCE cleanroom or otherwise add-on).

is it feasible/wothwhile for the people doing the gcj to include the 
gnu.crypto in their release?

i guess a more exhaustive list of what is failing might give us -me- a 
better clue of what is still missing.

A suggestion: use emacs on Windows, it does all the line ending
conversion for you.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hello,

I've put together a (fairly simple) cipher testing program that will read
in the standard test vector files that the NIST AES submissions required;
all that is involved in testing an algorithm foo with a 128 bit block size
is putting all the test vectors in a directory `tv/foo-128', then
instantiating the class test.cipher.NISTCipherTest. The class loads test
files with the `getResource' method of java.lang.Class, so the vector
files can simply be put into gnu-crypto-test.jar.

The patch only adds the class itself, and updates the build scripts and
test.cipher.AllTests. I didn't include the test files for the three AES
submitted ciphers in Classpathx, because they're probably far too big for
this mailing list.

I've also noted that in the file `Makefile.in' there is a line that says
`gnu/crypto/mac/UMash32.java' which I'm guessing should have read
`gnu/crypto/mac/UMac32.java'.

Cheers,

i'll pass on this one.  the features that the IDE i use has, far 
outweigh the few problems that it causes.  vim is enough to help me 
show/fix line-ending problems if/when they appear.

hello Casey,

thanks for your contribution :-)  it's a nice addition to the test suite 
of this library.

may i rename the "NISTCipherTest" to "TestOfNISTVectors" ?  it looks 
nicer with the other classes + i think conveys better what it is 
supposed to do.

...and yes, you guessed right; it is UMac32!

i'll generate (the test vectors) and test the new class before i check 
in the lot with all the corrections/amendements.


cheers;

hello there,

yesterday, i checked-in the following:

* latest contributions from Casey,
* modified versions of NistKat and NistMCT to generate the test vectors 
in separate files which makes using them, from Casey's 
TestOfNistVectors, straightforward.
* modified the build.xml to output the NIST test vectors in a 
subdirectory "nist" under tv/ and the NESSIE tests under the 
sub-directory "nessie" under tv/.
* corrections to the Makefile.in (in root directory),
* amendements to the same as well the both Makefile.am and Makefile.in 
(in gcj) and the Makefile.in (in gcj/source) to (a) include the new 
source(s) and (b) to invoke the NistKat and NistMCT tools with the new 
options.
* updated Casey's contributions in AUTHORS.

i think the modifications in the gcj related makefiles are incomplete. 
can somebody with a working gcj test this please.

i'll talk about the testing side of the library in a separate message.


cheers;

hello there,

test.cipher.TestOfSerpent is a model for testing a cipher's correctness, 
and i would like us to think on how we can use this pattern for testing 
all our symmetric key block ciphers.

things to consider:

* we should also test for the cloneability of our ciphers.  this can be 
as as easy as:

    a. initialise a cipher instance,
    b. encrypt one block,
    c. clone the cipher,
    d. encrypt a second block with both the cipher and its clone,
    e. verify that the result from both is the same.
    f. repeat the exercise with decryption.

* the TestOfSerpent uses test vector values that are hard-coded in the 
class.  should we (a) continue doing that, (b) use something similar to 
TestOfNistVectors where the test vector values are read from files in a 
pre-designated location, or (c) combine both approaches?

having hard-coded values that must be processed correctly for the test 
to pass, works around the fact that TestOfNistVectors does not fail if 
it cannot locate the files it is expecting.

besides, having hard-coded values inside the test-case, allows 
application of the (more or less) same pattern to non-NIST ciphers.

i'd go with (c).

* if we go with (b) or (c), how many hard-coded test vectors should we 
use?  --all of them is out of the question because of size and speed. 
theoretically one value should be enough, but 3 is more "re-assuring."

* should there be any special criteria for selecting the agreed number 
of test-vectors? or throwing a dice would suffice?

* once we have coded those TestOfxxx for our ciphers.  should we still 
keep the selfTest() method in the API and implementations?

in its actual form the setlfTest() for the ciphers only test for 
symmetry, which may be true even for incorrectly implemented ciphers. 
in other words it's almost useless!

we should change it to either (a) something similar to the selfTest() of 
hash algorithms, (b) something similar to the TestOfxxx discussed above 
with some hard-coded test vectors, or (c) get rid of it altogether!

* if we get rid of the selfTest() method in the API, how can we 
guarrantee that noone/nothing would replace our "tested" implementations 
with their (probably) insecure/leaking ones?  would a signed jar be enough?

* the test vectors generated by, at least, the NistKat and NistMCT tools 
should be included in the distribution, since they are used by the 
TestOfNistVectors, which (a) if amended to be more rigourous, and (b) 
passes all its tests for the test vector files, would constitute a 
comprehensive "bill-of-health" for the correctness of a cipher's 
implementation.

relying on the NistKat and NistMCT tools to generate them in-situ is not 
a valid option IMO.  a conscientious user would download these test 
vectors from a different source (NIST itself, the home page of the 
algorithm designers, or a trustworthy site/distribution), and only then 
run the TestOfNistVectors over them.

so am i contradicting myself? no.  am i putting more stringent 
conditions on what to distribute and how to distribute it? may be.

let me explain.

+ the NistKat and NistMCT tools are used only for (a) generating test 
vectors for new cipher implementation, and (b) for bootstraping the process.

+ once the test vector files are generated, they are "certified" (by a 
process which i still dont know how).  the end result would be a 
signed-jar for each of the NIST-compatible algorithms; eg. aes-tv.jar 
for the AES test vectors.

+ the gnu-crypto.jar is signed.

+ the TestOfNistVectors, or similar class, would use the cipher 
implementation from the gnu-crypto signed jar with the test vectors from 
the cipher's test vectors signed jar to assert the correctness of that 
cipher.

does it make sense?

* whatever we come with from the discussion of the previous point, a 
third jar, grouping the test vectors, and separate from the 
gnu-crypto.jar and gnu-crypto-test.jar should be considered.


comments and suggestions are welcome + cheers;

I would go with (c), too. As far as the number of test cases to hard-code,
I would recommend *at least* two of each of the monte-carlo tests, so there
is at least one change of key. This is because if a test only does the
first monte-carlo test, a problem with endianess *could* sneak by, since
the all-zero key looks the same regardless of endianness (this did happen
early on when I was working on the Serpent implementation, when I only
checked the all-zero key).

For the known-answer tests I would recommend using texts/keys where a bit
is set somewhere in each byte/nybble/word, to try to cover a range, not
just the first few.

Other than that I would simply use a Comfortable Round Number.

I would go for encrypting a known text, comparing the ciphertext with a
known answer, then decrypting it to see if it results in the plaintext.

let's say 5 values for each test, which makes a total of 30 --including 
the KAT ones.  the position of the bits for the latter, should be 
selected at random.

so a symmetry test but with known values.  yup; sounds good.


how do you want to split the work?

I think for the KA tests the number of tests should depend on the length of
the key/text, by (say) using the word 0x80000000 at all the possible word
(dynner, 32 bit) aligned offsets, e.g.

   8000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   0000000080000000000000000000000000000000
   ...etc.

just because it is seems less arbitrary and spans the space of keys/texts.

I could do the TestOfXxxx classes, maybe make a general superclass that
does the work, and subclasses that simply fill in the test vectors.

i'm not sure.  if the cipher is not correctly implemented, it's highly 
unlikely to pass some KATs and fails others.

even if this is the case, a cipher implementation should be deemed 
correct iff it passes *all* the tests!

excellent;  a base test-case for the TestOfxxx ciphers would be great!

i'll do the selfTest() implementations.

ps. checkout the latest TestOfSerpent and Util before you start.


cheers;

Patch for the test classes is attached. It consists of a base test class
and the five TestOf* classes modified to make use of it.

Absolutely. I decided to just use sequential texts (shift one bit to the
right each time) instead of random/arbitrary ones. It is simpler to program
and to produce tests, and the monte carlo tests exercise the algorithms
enough that errors are unlikely to sneak by.

i havent had a chance to look at your code yet --was busy getting my cvs 
  client working again-- but i'll checkin this stuff along with mine 
during the weekend.

the log entries will be shorter than usual since i wont be using wincvs 
for some time; unless someone can point out how to get vim configured to 
be the editor for use with the cvs cmd-line client tool.

the env var: EDITOR needs to be set to the path of your editor (in
this case, vim).

On windoze machines you sometimes have trouble with CVS not finding
the pserver password file but that shouldn't matter if you're using
ssh.


What else is there?

A. where we're at
-------------------

earlier i wrote:
 > ...
 > test.cipher.TestOfSerpent is a model for testing a cipher's 
correctness...

today's checkin concludes that part which leaves the library in the
following state:

* hash and cipher algorithms have a selfTest() method which is
guarranteed to be called by the respective Factories when asked to
provide a specific implementation.

* the selfTest() method when invoked for the first time, compares the
result of processing a designated input against a knwon pre-computed
output value.  when the two values agree, a "validity" flag is set to true.

* the cached value of the validity flag is re-used in recurrent 
invocations of the selfTest() methods.

* all the TestOfxxx cipher test-cases now follow a similar pattern which 
consists of:

    a. test the validity;
    b. test the cloneability;
    c. run 5 tests each of KAT VK, VT, MCT ECB Encryption and
       Decryption for one block size and each key-size in the set
       formed by the intersection of (i) the cipher's supported key
       sizes and (ii) the set of the following 3 values: 128, 192
       and 256.

* in addition, the top-level test harness, runs a general verification 
test if previously generated test vectors are found in a pre-deisngated 
location (tv/nist/...).  this test assumes the input test vector files 
follow a naming and have a specific format described by NIST --and hence 
may have been generated by 3rd parties using other tools than this library.

* the NIST tools, have been changed to allow generation of similar test 
vector files.


B. where do we go from here
-----------------------------

1. review the hash TestOfxxx and see if a similar pattern can be applied 
and/or is it worth it.

2. include in the build process the generation, in a separate jar, of 
the (at least) the NIST test vectors.

3. ensure that all the build tools (ant, top-level make, and preferably 
automakejar, as well as gcj/make):

    a. run the same tests,
    b. build the same deliverables.

ant's build.xml should be the reference.


once this list is done then we're ready for the first public release.


C. what's next for the near future
------------------------------------

1. do we go for the signed test-vector jars?
2. do we (PGP) sign our distribution?
3. can we get the library integrated with the gcj release --from 
Olivier's tests it sounded like our JCE adapters fill a missing niche in 
their distribution?


D. what's next for the medium-term future
-------------------------------------------

1. start the adapters for the javax.security SPIs.
2. what to do with ASN.1 related stuff?
3. work out a process for selecting new algorithms to implement.


comments, suggestions, volunteers are more than welcome ;-)

Well done. Excellent work.

I hope soon to have some more time to sort out the automakejar
issues. I have a Windoze pc at work so I'll install cygwin on it and
see if I can get it all working.


I would help with the GCJ issues but my GCJ is broken right now /8-<

is there a particular person you'd recommend to talk to about 
integrating gnu.crypto with the GNU java classes (java.security.* packages)?

You should just pitch on the Classpath list.

Do you guys have a JCA/JCE implementation?

ok.


> Do you guys have a JCA/JCE implementation?

no we dont; but we have implementations of MD5, SHA, DSA implementatios 
and adapters to hook them into a standard JDK --or compliant in the 
sense of what GNU classpath is developing; i.e. the java.* packages.

code is also available for including ASN.1 DER classes for x.509 
certificates and the like.

we also plan on providing adapters for use by JCE/JCA implementations 
from Sun (jdk1.4) or cleanroom ones (bouncycastle, cryptix, etc...) for 
pre jdk1.4 --the javax.security.* packages.

Sorry for the delay! I am stuck with another home project for the moment
and don't seem to get anything going!

Anyway, this is the output I get from the JUnit test suite under GCJ
version: gcc (GCC) 3.2 20020518.

 From this result, it looks very broken but I don't think it is. All the
basic tests from the crypto.tools directory are running just fine. I
think that gnu-crypto is essentially working with GCJ. 
The JUnit test suite is more likely to be badly broken because of
missing security classes in GCJ than compilation problems or 
compiler/runtime bugs.

Oli

This is only a snippets of the output, I attach the full file as well.

i had a look at the classpath implementation of the
MessageDigest.getInstance and i know why this is throwing the exception:
the implemetation *does not* handle algorithm aliasing at all!

a simple fix is to replace the following line in the above method (with
2 arguments) with the following:

- return getInstance(p.getProperty("MessageDigest." + algorithm),
algorithm, p);

+ // try the name as is
+ String className = p.getProperty("MessageDigest." + algorithm);
+ if (className == null) { // try all uppercase
+    String upper = algorithm.toUpperCase();
+    className = p.getProperty("MessageDigest." + upper);
+    if (className == null) { // try if it's an alias
+       String alias = p.getProperty("Alg.Alias.MessageDigest." +
algorithm);
+       if (alias == null) { // spit the dummy
+          throw new NoSuchAlgorithmException(algorithm);
+       }
+       className = p.getProperty("MessageDigest." + alias);
+       if (className == null) {
+          throw new NoSuchAlgorithmException(algorithm);
+       }
+    }
+ }
+ return getInstance(className, algorithm, p);

looking at gnu.crypto.rsa.RSAKeyPairGenerator, and the classpath
BigInteger implementation, the exception is thrown from line 205 (in the
RSA keypair generator):

d = e.modInverse(phi);

the problem is that if we made it to that line, this exception should
not be thrown, hence the cause may be in how modInverse is implemented 
in the concrete BigInteger class.  i'll inspect the source later.

suspect (without knowing at which line it was thrown) that it's at the

similar problem (and similar work-around) to the MessageDigest.getInstance()

First of all be aware that "classpath" and "gcj" don't always share
the same code. They are merging differences step by step. 
In gcj the classes are under:

   gcc/libjava/java

The gcj implementation of MessageDigest looks the same as classpath.
I haven't tried your patch yet. I did try the naive approach of replacing:

   MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA", GNU);
   ...
   ...
   MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("WHirlpool", GNU);

with:

   MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-160", GNU);
   ...
   ...
   MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("WHIRLPOOL", GNU);

In TestOfProvider.java, I now get:

java.lang.ClassCastException: gnu.crypto.jce.Sha160Spi cannot be cast to
java.security.MessageDigest
...
...
java.lang.ClassCastException: gnu.crypto.jce.WhirlpoolSpi cannot be cast
to java.security.MessageDigest

???

this is a 2nd bug in the MessageDigest implementation (method 
getInstance with 3 args) caused by the line:


MessageDigest m =
       (MessageDigest) Class.forName(classname).newInstance();

the fix is:

1. to catch the ClassCastException,
2. test if the newly instantiated class is an instance of 
java.security.MessageDigestSpi,
3. if it isnt throw the exception, otherwise
4. wrap the newly instantiated class in a proxy class that channels the 
MessageDigest calls to the wrapped Spi class.


how about that!  we started testing our code, and ended up testing the 
gcj/classpath.

do you have enough info to file bug reports?

i checked in this afternoon an implementation of David McGrew's TMMH/16 
(version 1) -gnu.crypto.mac.TMMH16- as well as a test case for it 
-test.mac.TestOfTMMH16.  this is in preparation for the implementation 
of the UST (Universal Security Transform).

the count of tests is now up to 93!  i.e. if you run:

ant test

you should see at the end:

[junit] OK (93 tests)


other classes were also amended to allow instantiation for this new 
algorithm.

i also implemented Cloneability for the PRNG implementations we already 
have.

I have updated the GCJ build to support JUnit testing.

Basically configure supports an extra flag:

  --with-junit-jar=/path/to/junit.jar

If this flag is given, the generated makefiles will build the JUnit
test suite.

Note that you must have a native JUnit shared library build with GCJ as
well. I have put together instructions on how to do that at:

   http://www.zipworld.com.au/~olivier/gcj.html


However since I updated to the latest crypto sources I get:

tournesol:~/tmp/ccc$ source/junitTest 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.InternalError: anubis-128

It looks like Anubis cipher does not pass its selftest anymore? or is it
a new feature?

I'll investigate more.

I also have to try your GCJ patches Raif.

hello guys,

i've checked in more JCE Adapters to wrap all our secure PRNG 
implementations, and added a small test to the TestOfProvider in 
test.jce for that.

earlier i checked in an implementation of David McGrew's UST algorithm. 
  i'm still waiting for its review --which is why i didnt announce it 
earlier.

finally i updated the build.xml, Makefile.in (in toplevel) and 
Makefile.am (in gcj/source).  i tested the two former ones but was 
unable to try the gcj version because (a) dont have a working gcj and 
(b) dont have autoconfigure2.50.

i'd like to aim for the 30th of August as the date for the first public 
release of the library.  so from now on it's concentrating on:

a. the documentation: organisation, spelling, clarity, etc...
b. the build process: ANT and the 2 makes --i/we probably would need 
help with Nic's automakejar tool; any takers?
c. sort out the test vector issue; and finally
d. sort out signing the distribution issue.

volunteers for above tasks, and ideas/suggestions about the still open 
issues are welcome.


cheers;
rsn

I have updated the GCJ build accordingly.
Both crypto library and JUnit test suite build successfully however
Anubis still does not pass its self test!

Making the GCJ build mostly useless for now... Anyway it is there.

Anubis does not have anything specially different than the other ciphers 
--in terms of the java language constructs and invocations.  does any 
other cipher pass its self-test?

it was brought to my attention that there may be some export issues 
regarding the distribution of gnu.crypto code.

the concern is related to the fact that: although most of the developers 
reside outside the USA, the gnu.crypto project is officially distributed 
(a) by the FSF (b) from the USA.  is anybody aware of any limitation or 
legal issues that should be addressed before we release/distribute our 
code?  should an FSF legal person be consulted on this?

Hi,

I noticed that a couple of people on this list try to get gnu.crypto
working with gcj. I hope that I can help a bit and I had recently merged
the GNU Classpath security provider classes with libgcj (GNU Classpath
and libgcj are merging but it will take some time before everything is
merged see http://gcc.gnu.org/java/libgcj-classpath-compare.html).
Unfortunately the addition of those files broken the powerpc build in
some mysterious way so I had to remove them again. Since this does not
seem to impact any other platform you might want to wait updating your
libgcj tree again if you depend on those files being present. Below is
the ChangeLog entry. I hope that I can figure out this weekend what
exactly broke and add these files again to libgcj.

2002-08-01  Mark Wielaard  <mark@klomp.org>

    Revert patch that breaks libgcj shared library on powerpc:
    * gnu/java/security/provider/Gnu.java: Reverse referencing all
    implementation classes by using Class.getName(). Uses Strings again.
    * gnu/java/security/der/DEREncodingException.java,

    gnu/java/security/provider/MD5.java,
    gnu/java/security/util/Prime.java: Removed.
    * Makefile.am (ordinary_java_source_files): Remove above files.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerate.

    Permissions.
    * gnu/java/security/provider/SHA.java

    (engineDigest): Revert algorithm change.

For more info on the breakage see

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Mark

I don't think there are any issues anymore.

Can you tell me (privately please) who the developers for the project
are (in the past as well as now) and where they reside?

I will consult the relevant people for you.

(Caveat: IANAL)

I think, according to Export Administrations Regulations section 740.13(e),
open-source encryption software can be exported without regulation, as
long as (1) it is not made available for download to Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria and (2) you notify the Bureau of
Industry and Security at <crypt@bis.doc.gov> before it is made publicly
available.

Want to sift through United States export regulations? Look at

	http://w3.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html

Part 740, which appears to be the relevant one, is at:

	http://w3.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/{pdf,txt}/740.{pdf,txt}

I think this is an optimization bug in GCJ. I inspected the selfTest()
method, and using good old print-out-the-state debugging found out that
selfTest() actually passes all of its tests -- ie it gets past the two
nested for loops -- but for some reason returns false. I re-made the
GCJ build after removing the -O2 flag and every cipher test succeeds.
It also works with just -O.

As for the other two build methods, Ant works for me, yet the top-level
make seems to want either the NIST test vectors to be in the tree, or
wants to try to build them (and there is no target for them). I'm guessing
that the test vectors will be included in the distribution, or that the
Makefile will not include these files and there will be a pointer in
the documentation to download and test these files.

I did some profiling of the libraries and discovered that because Serpent
creates a new integer array for every block it processes, a LOT of objects
are allocated during execution. This could be a problem in low-memory
devices, where a lot of time will be taken up with garbage collection.

Making the integer array 'x' on lines 597 and 686 a private instance
variable will correct this, but breaks thread-safety (if that's an issue).

excellent detective work!  are the gcj people aware of this?  would it 
help'em if you submit a bug-report with sample code?

i'm spending this weekend looking at this.  i'm more or less convinced 
that the test-vectors (a) can be generated by a special target in the 
make/ant files, that can be invoked on its own, and (b) should be jarred 
and made available for download.  unless somebody convinces me otherwise 
this is how i shall be proceeding.

we can always use the "lock" object in the BaseCipher to protect those 
code blocks.

the other 2 alternatives are:

* in-line the transform() (and its inverse) in the encrypt() and 
decrypt() methods, and use 4 ints rather than the int[].

* re-write the code to eliminate the need for this array. (i'll send you 
  in private an implementation i did for the Serpent's authors for their 
AES submission that may give you an idea about what i'm talking about).


i guess we have to add to our checklist of TODO list before the release 
the thread-safety issue you raise.  when we identify such a case the 
documentation has to make it clear that it is an issue the user has to 
be aware of; e.g. something in the class javadoc like:

<p><b>Implementation issue:</b> This implementation is not 
thread-safe... </p>

or something like that.

I'll look at their list archives to see if this has come up before; if
not I'll post a message.

I was testing out an evaluation version of a Java profiler (I think it
was JProfiler -- which isn't worth it; proprietary and too expensive)
and put it through its paces by running the gnu-crypto test suite (plus
testing the full NIST vectors).

I was rather shocked/amused to see the number of int arrays climb to
25,000, then fall back to zero while Serpent was running.

Won't work. The S-Box functions would also need to be in-lined, and this
would make the code much less readable.

(It's situations like this that make me want a Java preprocessor.)

I'll look into this.

Or mention generally that the library is not necessarily thread-safe, if
thread safety is not a big issue for this library.

hi guys,

i just checked in some bug-fixes, few additions and one new tool: Ent 
--a java port of John Walker's ENT program (see

indices for a given stream to assess its degree of randomness.

here is the output of:  ant ent

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 13 seconds


sorting the indices by:

* time: shows that UMacGenerator is the fastest, and ICMGenerator is the 
slowest;
* mean % deviation: shows that UMacGenerator is the closest to 0.5 and 
Whirlpool is the farthest;
* scc: shows that MD4-based PRNG is closest to 0.0, and RIPEMD-160-based 
PRNG is the farthest;

it would be nice, if someone goes through the code and make sure i didnt 
code the formulae incorrectly and, may be in the future, add more 
indices and/or a gui face to the tool.


i'll continue working on the build and make files for now.

cheers;

Finally figured out what the real problem was.
<http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2002-08/msg00025.html>
The patch has been reverted. Please make sure you are using binutils
version 2.12.90.0.15 or higher when working with a recent CVS checkout
of libgcj.

Cheers,

Mark

hi guys,

i've checked in recently some mods to the build.xml, Makefile.in 
(toplevel) and Makefile.am (gcj/source).

except for the latter, i tested both the ant build process as well as 
the gnu make one (toplevel again).

i would appreciate it if somebody can double-check by, at least, doing:

* ant release

and/or

$ ./configure
$ RELEASE=1.0.0 make -e release

and, for each:

$ md5sum --check gnu-crypto-1.0.0.md5

i've also tagged the module with ver_1_0_0 in preparation of the release.

i'm now going through the javadoc.

a few days ago, i added some tables to the home page showing the results 
of the library's tools.  again, a critical eye would be helpful.


cheers;

hello there,

i went though the generated javadocs, and after fixing some minor html
tags in few classes that were causing emission of javadoc warnings, i
believe the library is ready for its birthday release.

unless somebody else notes otherwise, we are ready for the release.

since i also started using jdk 1.4 (j2sdk1.4.0_01 and j2sdk1.4.1) i
noticed that more javadoc warnings are emitted unless a "-breakiterator"
option is included in the command line of the javadoc tool (thru ANT 1.5
but this is secondary).  i refactored the "docs" ant task and added some
testes to invoke the javadoc tool with appropriate options depending on
the jdk used to run the ant tool.

i also tagged both the sources and the web pages in the cvs trees with
tha tag "ver_1_0_0".

the 3 remaining questions/tasks before the release are:

1. draft the announcement text and decide where to publish it,
2. move the deliverables to a download location,
3. decide on an incantation to cover export control sensitivities.

re. #1, i'll send later a draft of the announcement text for comments.

re. #2, the home page refers to <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/classpathx>
where there's already a crypto-build-demo.tar.gz that i believe Nic put
there while working on the Makefile process.  2 questions:

q1. should we use this location or a "crypto" subdirectory underneath to
mirror the web pages organisation?
q2. how can i upload files to the agreed location?

re. #3, i propose replacing:

"You can download..."

which is the first paragraph of the "Downloads" section, to

"Provided you are legally allowed, you can download..."

comments?


cheers;
rsn

hi there,

here is the proposed announcement text.  the list of recepients is given 
at the end.  i also intend on forwarding a copy to the included 
algorithms' author(s).

-----

The GNU Crypto team is proud to anounce the release of the first version 
of the gnu.crypto library.

GNU Crypto is a 100% Java implementation of cryptographic algorithms and 
tools, and includes a Java Cryptographic Provider implementation to 
allow its use through the Java JCA framework and APIs.

GNU Crypto includes, in addition to the now standard cryptographic 
primitives (MD5, SHA-1, AES, etc.), implementations of new and 
experimental cryptographic primitives and transforms such as Universal 
Hash Algorithms (UMAC32, TMMH-16 v1), the Universal Security Transform 
(UST), and others.

More details on the rationale, and contents of the library can be found 
on the project's home page at: 
<http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/crypto/crypto.html>. 
Deliverables are available from: <xxx>

hi there,

here is a revised version.  i added the reference to NESSIE, and 
clarified that the project is under the aegis of GNU.

-----

The GNU Crypto team is proud to anounce the release of the first version
of the gnu.crypto library.

GNU Crypto, part of the GNU project, released under the aegis of GNU, is 
a 100% Java implementation of cryptographic algorithms and
tools, and includes a Java Cryptographic Provider implementation to
allow its use through the Java JCA framework and APIs.

GNU Crypto includes, in addition to the now standard cryptographic
primitives (MD5, SHA-1, AES, etc.), implementations of new and
experimental cryptographic primitives and transforms such as Universal
Hash Algorithms (UMAC32, TMMH-16 v1), the Universal Security Transform
(UST), and others.  GNU Crypto also includes implementations of some of 
the accepted (2nd round) NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, 
Integrity, and Encryption) project such as Anubis, Khazad, Whirlpool, etc.

More details on the rationale, and contents of the library can be found
on the project's home page at:
<http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/crypto/crypto.html>.
Deliverables are available from: <xxx>

It's food.

I'd prefer if you said "part of the GNU ClasspathX project".

I'd also prefer if you waited till we had some text about crypto
export. However, the maintainers support forum are usually quite slow
to respond... the question is do we put the FSF at risk by offering
this for download without the text?

I guess one of the things we can do is offer it for download from
a European country. However, the CVS is in the states and there's not
much we can do about that.

hello guys,

below is, hopefully, the final draft of the announcement.  shortly i'll 
update the main home page to reflect the new download urls.

i'd like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Werner Koch, the 
maintainer of GNU Privacy Guard, for his help in ironing the 
export-related issue, and for allowing his ftp site to be gnu.crypto's 
main download site.

A couple of points about the web-site:

1) The links at the top (most importantly the one that leads to the
    downloads section--which is at the bottom of the page!) don't
    lead to their "intended" targets! E.g. the downloads link is:

       <a href="#downloading" name="downloading">Downloads</a>

    which just scrolls the "Downloads" text to the top of the window
    (at least in Mozilla 1). The fix is to just remove (or change) the
    name="" attributes from the anchors at the top of the page.

2) In the "Reference Documentation" section, there could be links for
    Serpent and MD4. Similarly in the "Test Vectors" section for
    Serpent.

3) The cipherSpeed and hashSpeed tables should be qualified with how
    the programs were run (what JVM, what architecture, &c.).

Otherwise it looks good to me; nice work.

done.  the updated version will be visible as soon as the page will get 
synchronised (within the next 24-h).  you can alway inspect the CVS copy 
  at 
<http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/software/classpathx/crypto/crypto.html?rev=1.14&cvsroot=www.gnu.org&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup>

(I'm CC'ing this to the crypto list, too)

Attached is a patch to modify Serpent to use Dag Arne Osvik's inlined
versions of the encryption and decryption methods. The key setup is
still the same as before.

The bad news is that it is NOT always faster than the current
implementation. When run on Sun's HotSpot VMs (I've tried 1.3.1_04-b02,
1.4.0-b92, and 1.4.1-rc-b19 on Linux) the JIT will refuse to compile the
encrypt and decrypt methods, and all en/decrypting is done in
interpreted mode. Thus it is not much faster than interpreted mode (my
guess is that Sun is terminally too clever for their own good, and
their JIT will not compile methods that are too big or take too long to
compile).

The good news is that with other VMs this implementation is MUCH faster.
Kaffe (version 1.0.6, JIT v3) can get ~5.5 MB/s, and a native version
produced by GCJ runs at ~8 MB/s (second fastest for encryption, behind
Rijndael, and neck-and-neck with Anubis for decryption).

If we can come up with a way to make this inlined version more
digestible for certain JITs, I think this would be a good implementation
for future releases.

If you split the function in 2 or more chunks of code, their JIT will at
some point become able to compile each chunk.

On what kind of processor?

I'm a bit curious about what kind of code GCJ produces.  Could you mail me
the compiled code, or even better, assembly output (-S)?

i see some advantages in keeping the current implementation _and_ adding
the new in-lined one as an alternative; say SerpentInLined? (naming
suggestions are welcome)


i'll start a new thread about discussing this alternative in general;
i.e. how can we [re-]write the Factory methods to provide the _optimal_
implementation.

i'll also start another thread about collecting and publishing
performance figures which, ultimately may allow us to tailor the
heuristic for selecting one implementation among many, depending on the
host environment.

pointers to finding out more about JIT nuts and bolts, anybody?

Just a misplaced declaration.  Move the declaration of x0,...,x4 inside
both encrypt() and decrypt().

As expected, and not very good.  Still, code size for fully inlined
encryption & decryption for x86 is less than 6.3k bytes.  Key expansion
is 3.7k.  Java byte code is probably not as compact as x86 code, but
surely there is some overhead we could remove?

> c. runs almost 20 times slower than the current one!

This can be fixed too, as mentioned in my reply to Casey.  We just have
to work around compiler limitations.  Nothing new here..

AMD Athlon MP 1200. It's a two-processor machine, but only one gets used
(since it is running in a single thread).

This code is attached, bzipped. It is the output of the patched version
I posted earlier compiled with `-O -S'.

|
| this version:
|

The attached version should be; it still declares the five register
variables (x0..x4) as global for the class, but declares the encrypt
and decrypt methods to be explicitly synchronized. This doesn't appear
to affect speed, unless you're encrypting and decrypting in parallel.

Bigger classes will always result from such extensive unrolling; this
version does a bit better (each S-Box is in its own method, and I
removed the static sboxI* and transform methods, since they're no longer
needed). Once this version has an inlined key setup the static methods
can disappear completely.

| c. runs almost 20 times slower than the current one!
|

Because of the JIT. Sun's HotSpot can handle this one better.

I was aiming for the following with this version:

1) Keep constant array indices.
2) Keep methods short, so the JIT can handle them.
3) Don't repeat too much code (e.g. there is a one function per S-Box).

The results are a good compromise:

~            Sun 1.4.0         GCJ (native)       Kaffe 1.0.6
encrypt   4584.8003 KB/s     6262.5254 KB/s    4283.1689 KB/s
decrypt   4861.5435 KB/s     6230.0640 KB/s    4662.7871 KB/s

(all on an AMD MP 1200). Much better for Sun's VM, a little slower for
GCJ and Kaffe, and better than the current version. By the way with this
version GNU's Serpent will be faster than BouncyCastle's.

| i see some advantages in keeping the current implementation _and_ adding

|

I wonder if a naming scheme following "SerpentSBoxImpl" or something
similar is more appropriate, since what we're talking about here is a
particular implementation of "bit-sliced" S-Boxes.

|
| i'll start a new thread about discussing this alternative in general;
| i.e. how can we [re-]write the Factory methods to provide the _optimal_
| implementation.
|
| i'll also start another thread about collecting and publishing
| performance figures which, ultimately may allow us to tailor the
| heuristic for selecting one implementation among many, depending on the
| host environment.
|
|
| | If we can come up with a way to make this inlined version more

|

|

There's this: <http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/VMOptions.html> which
says that HotSpot JITs can take the option -Xmaxjitcodesize<size>.
Generated code size is obviously not the problem, since trying the fully
inlined version with outrageously huge compiled code sizes results in
equivalent performance. I can't find anything relating to time spent in
the compiler.

Sun has published some books on their JITs, none of which I've seen,
though.

Cheers,

/**
 * <p>Serpent is a 32-round substitution-permutation network block cipher,
 * operating on 128-bit blocks and accepting keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits in
 * length. At each round the plaintext is XORed with a 128 bit portion of the
 * session key -- a 4224 bit key computed from the input key -- then one of
 * eight S-boxes are applied, and finally a simple linear transformation is
 * done. Decryption does the exact same thing in reverse order, and using the
 * eight inverses of the S-boxes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen as a
 * proposed cipher for the Advanced Encryption Standard.</p>
 *
 * <p>Serpent can be sped up greatly by replacing S-box substitution with a
 * sequence of binary operations, and the optimal implementation depends
 * upon finding the fastest sequence of binary operations that reproduce this
 * substitution. This implementation uses the S-boxes discovered by
 * <a href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~osvik/">Dag Arne Osvik</a>, which are

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: RIPEMD160

hello everyone,

in the last few days, and thanks to Dag Arne Osvik contribution and
Casey's work, the prospect of having more than one implementation of the
same Algorithm is now real.

practically speaking, we may have for some algorithms more than one
implementation, each exhibiting different features, and may be in
specific circumstances, better than the other(s).  the problem is then:

1. should we handle this situation? and
2. if yes, how?


except for Mode and Padding, our algorithms can be instantiated with a
public constructor.  this is enough for someone who already _knows_ (a)
how many implementation(s) there are for a given algorithm, and (b) how
they differ from each other (when there's more than one).

but this is not good enough for the majority of users.  they know (or
expected to know) the _environment_ in which the algorithm is supposed
to operate, but not which is the _best_ implementation for that
algorithm in that environment.  it is desirable, if the user can
communicate the description of the operating environment and a set of
preferences, and in return obtain the _right_ implementation for the job.

observation #1: the name of the algorithm alone is not the best way of
selecting one among many implementations of a designated algorithm.

also, in some rare situations -i'll give an example later- a user may
not be interested at all in a specific algorithm but rather in other
criteria that the algorithm's _type_ is capable of providing.  an
example would be to encrypt a username+password for a database user.
the question such user would be asking is: what is the fastest available
implementation of a block cipher that i have which can encrypt 16-byte
at a time, using a 16-byte key?

observation #2: which algorithm to use (the name) may not be the most
important criterion when selecting an implementation.

on the other hand, how can a provider of an algorithm's
implementation(s), know _a priori_ what are the possible user's
preference attributes, so he can accomodate them?  more importatnly, how
can the _seamntics_ of those attributes be interpreted similarly by more
than one provider?

observation #3: there is no universal set of preferences/attributes that
providers can share, or agree to interpret the same way.


now we already have in place a Factory pattern that allows users to
select the algorithm by name; e.g.:

~   gnu.crypto.cipher.CipherFactory.getInstance(foo);

furthermore, we have defined in our API, methods that forces the
implementor to expose some intrinsic attributes of the type of algorithm
being implemented; e.g.:

~   Iterator i = gnu.crypto.cipher.IBlockCipher.blockSizes();
~   Iterator j = gnu.crypto.cipher.IBlockCipher.keySizes();

in addition, at the global level, we have Factory methods to return the
names of all implemented algorithms; e.g.:

~   Iterator i = gnu.crypto.cipher.CipherFactory.getNames();


so what are we missing?

* the name, and some intrinsic attributes related to the type of the
algorithm --and these would change for each type-- are not enough.
intuitively speed should be another factor;  size of the byte-code may
be a factor.  what else?

* the platform is a factor.  java runs everywhere but it does not run
the same way.


hence the questions we should answer (in addition to the initial ones) are:

3. what are the possible criteria a user may specify for selecting an
implementation?

4. can we forsee all possible criteria or should we allow the solution
to cater for criteria that may be added in the future?

5. how are we going to compute/collect/set the values for the selected
criteria in combination with possible environment --i.e. static,
runtime, both?

6. how are we going to let the users tell us what they want? (system
properties, command line options, opaque object in Factory methods)


comments? suggestions?


cheers;

Where they intersect (the "cool" AES candidates Rijndael, Serpent, and
Twofish) BC wins with Twofish, while GNU's Rijndael does better.

Take, of course, these benchmarks with as large a grain of salt as you
see fit 8-).

I don't see any compelling reason to keep the old one. Plus I like the
new version better -- passing arrays to the S-box and transform methods
was clever, but probably not the best way to do it.

As one more idea, attached is a version of Serpent that Dag sent me that
replaces the int[] version of the session key with a new class,
SerpentKey, which just has 132 integer fields k0..k131. This avoids
bounds-checking, and I can get this version up to 15MB/s when compiled
with GCJ.

   http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnu-crypto-discuss

tomorrow (the end-of-month) i'll download the archives of this list and=20
make them available from the project's (new) homepage, so we can have=20
(historic) continuity.  when i'll do that i'll also update the homepage=20
accordingly.  so please, starting from tomorrow, refrain my using this=20
list.
