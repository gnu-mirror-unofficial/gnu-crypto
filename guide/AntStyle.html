<ol>
<LI><B>Source files</B>
	<P>ANT source files should begin with the xml directive &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;,
	followed by the project standard copyright notice:</P>

<LI><B>Names</B>
	<P>Always use lowercase names.</P>

	<P>Use hyphens to compose target names, dots to compose property names and
	finally underscores to compose idref names. For example:</P>

	<pre>
	&lt;target name="amoun-ra">...</target>
	&lt;target ... if="install.dir">...</target>
	&lt;patternset id="toplevel_files">...</patternset>
	</pre>
</LI>

<LI><B>Indentation</B>
	<P>Do not use tabs.  Always use spaces.  Three spaces should be used as the
	unit of indentation.</P>

	<OL>
		<LI><B>Line length</B>
			<P>Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, since they're not handled
			well by many terminals and tools.</P>
		</LI>

		<LI><B>Wrapping lines</B>
			<P>When an ANT xml element will not fit on a single line, break it on
			an attribute basis and align all attribute names.  For example:</P>

			<pre>
		<javac destdir="classes"
				 debug="${debug}"
				 optimize="${optimize}"
				 srcdir="src"
				 includes="gnu/crypto/**/*.java"/>
			</pre>
		</LI>
	</OL>
</LI>

<LI><B>Comments</B>
	<P>Target group comments help separate visually blocks of related targets.
	Use the following before each group:</P>

	<pre>
	&lt;!--
	Minimal tests to pass before release .......................................
	-->
	&lt;target ... />
	</pre>
</LI>

<LI><B>Example</B>
	<P>Refer to the project's build.xml as an example of these recommendations.</P>
</LI>
