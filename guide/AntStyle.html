   Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
   making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
   conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
   combination.

   As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give

   independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
   executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
   for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
   license of that module.  An independent module is a module which is
   not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this
   library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
   library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
   do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

<LI><B>Names</B>
	<P>Always use lowercase names.</P>

	<P>Use hyphens to compose target names, dots to compose property names and
	finally underscores to compose idref names. For example:</P>

	<pre>
&lt;target name="amoun-ra">...</target>
&lt;target ... if="install.dir">...</target>
&lt;patternset id="toplevel_files">...</patternset>
	</pre>
</LI>

<LI><B>Indentation</B>
	<P>Do not use tabs.  Always use spaces.  Three spaces should be used as the
	unit of indentation.</P>

	<OL>
		<LI><B>Line length</B>
			<P>Avoid lines longer than 100 characters, since they're not handled
			well by many terminals and tools.</P>
		</LI>

		<LI><B>Wrapping lines</B>
			<P>When an ANT xml element will not fit on a single line, break it on
			an attribute basis and align all attribute names.  For example:</P>

			<pre>
&lt;javac destdir="classes" debug="${debug}" optimize="${optimize}"
       srcdir="src" includes="gnu/crypto/**/*.java"/>
			</pre>
		</LI>
	</OL>
</LI>

<LI><B>Comments</B>
	<P>Target group comments help separate visually blocks of related targets.
	Use the following before each group:</P>

	<pre>
&lt;!--
Minimal tests to pass before release .......................................
-->
&lt;target ... />
	</pre>
</LI>

<LI><B>Example</B>
	<P>Refer to the project's <code>build.xml</code> as an example of these recommendations.</P>
