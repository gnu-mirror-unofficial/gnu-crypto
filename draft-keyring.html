                      The GNU Keyring File Format

Status of this Memo

   This document is a ‘‘rough draft,’’ and should not be considered a
   fixed format. The values and structures described below are subject
   to change without notice.

   This is not an Internet-Draft, and is not associated with or endorsed
   by the Internet Engineering Task Force. We use the format of
   Internet-Drafts and RFCs for convenience and familiarity.

Abstract

   This is a proposal for a new keyring format, to be used by GNU Java
   implementations (Classpath, GCJ, GNU Crypto) as the official
   ‘‘keystore’’ format for those platforms. It need not be limited to
   Java platforms, however, as it is flexible enough a format to
   accommodate different applications.

1. Introduction.

   The GNU Keyring file format is a proposed standard file format for
   the long-term storage of cryptographic data, such as private keys and
   digital certificates. This format is being designed with the
   following goals:

    * Protection of trusted credentials, through the use of a password-
      based MAC (message authentication code) over these credentials.

    * Protection of secret credentials, through the use of a password-
      based MAC over the data, which is encrypted with a strong,
      password-based cipher.

    * Management of disparate types of cryptographic data, such as
      different types of digital certificate.

    * Extensibility. It should be possible to extend the file format
      when new requirements arise, without undo breakage of existing
      applications.

    * Compatibility with the JDK. This means that it should be possible
      to use this format as a keystore, so GNU implementations of the
      Java platform can provide the same functionality as the JDK.

   An implementation of this format is included in the Free Software
   Foundation’s GNU Crypto project, a cryptographic library written in
   Java. The full copyright of GNU Crypto is included at the end of this
   document.

1.1. Data Types.

   Data read and written to keyrings will be one of the following types:



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 2]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   uint8     An unsigned byte.

   uint16    An unsigned two-byte integer, in big-endian byte order.

   unit32    An unsigned four-byte integer.

   uint64    An unsigned eight-byte integer.

   octet sequence (os)
          An arbitrary byte array, stored as

             1. the length of the byte array, encoded in a uint8.
             2. the bytes themselves.

   extended octet sequence (eos)
          An arbitrary byte array, stored as

             1. the length of the byte array, encoded in a uint32.
             2. the bytes themselves.

   u8string  A sequence of UTF-8 bytes, stored as the a uint16 length
          field, then that many bytes. (see java.io.DataOutput.writeUTF)

   bigint    An arbitrary-precision signed integer, stored as

             1. the length of the byte array, encoded in a uint32.
             2. the minimum number of bytes in two’s complement notation.

   byte[l]   A fixed-length byte array, stored without length.

1.2. Notation.

   When defining constants in this document, we shall use the following
   style, similar to the C preprossesor:

      #define CONSTANT_NAME VALUE

   When showing the format of packets, we use the following form,
   assuming that fields are concatenated from top to bottom:

      type1            Description of field 1.
      type2            Description of field 2.
       ...

   To show the intended structure of compound types, we will use the
   following Lisp-like notation:

      (level-1



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 3]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


        (level-2
          (level-3)
        )
      )

   By this we mean that the entity named ‘level-1’ contains the entity
   named ‘level-2’, which in turn contains the entity named ‘level-3’,
   which is a primitive type and contains no other sub-types.

   Numbers are written in base 10, unless they are prefixed by ‘0x’,
   when they will be written in base 16. Thus, the value ‘0x0123457’
   would mean the decimal value ‘1193047’.

   The key words ‘‘MUST’’, ‘‘MUST NOT’’, ‘‘REQUIRED’’, ‘‘SHALL’’,
   ‘‘SHALL NOT’’, ‘‘SHOULD’’, ‘‘SHOULD NOT’’, ‘‘RECOMMENDED’’, ‘‘MAY’’,
   and ‘‘OPTIONAL’’ in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in [RFC2119].

2. Magic Bytes/Version Number.

   To identify keyrings by content, and to protect against
   incompatibilities when the format evolves, all keyrings will begin
   with the following bytes:

      byte[3]             The bytes ‘‘GKR’’.
      uint8               Version number.

   The current version number shall be 1. Thus keyrings described in
   this document shall begin with the value 0x474b5201.

   In magic(5) parlance, this would be:

      0        string    GKR  GNU keyring file
      >3       byte      x    version %d

2.1. Ring Usage.

   Immediately following the four-byte magic and version data will be a
   one-byte ‘‘ring usage’’ field. The presence of set bits in this byte
   shall declare what may be stored in this keyring.

   The currently defined bits, from least-significant up, are:

      Bit     Meaning
      ---     -------
       0      Private keys may be stored in this keyring.
       1      Personal certificate chains and public keys may be
              stored in this keyring.



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 4]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


       2      Trusted certificates may be stored in this keyring.

   The remaining bits are undefined for this version of GNU keyrings,
   and MUST be ignored.

   The layout for particular keyring types are described in section 4,
   Required Layouts.

   Conformant implementations MUST be able to read keyrings with the
   following usage fields:

    * With only trusted certificates (bit 2).

    * With only private keys and personal certificate chains or public
      keys (bits 0 and 1).

   These two types correspond to ‘‘trusted credentials’’ and ‘‘personal
   credentials’’, respectfully. Since these two are the most common uses
   of key storage -- one way to securely store trusted credentials such
   as CA certificates, and one way to securely store public and private
   keys -- these types of keyrings are the ones REQUIRED by this format.

3. Packets.

   The keyring shall then contain one or more packets, constructs of the
   following form:

      uint8    Content-type.
      eos      Properties.
      byte[n]  Data, dependent upon content-type. n is not inherently
               fixed for a particular content-type, and may be zero.

   At the top level, following the magic bytes, there must be only a
   single packet. As such, the packet appearing first in the file is
   typically an envelope type, which contains some number of primitive
   types.

   The properties field is described in section 3.4.

3.1. Envelope Types.

   Envelope types contain other types, usually to transform their
   contents. The types are encoded by merely concatenating multiple
   types together, with the end of the sequence corresponding to the end
   of the octet sequence.

   All envelope types MUST contain a property "alias-list", the value of
   which will be composed of the concatenation of the following for each



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 5]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   of the contained types, separated by a single semicolon (’;’, Unicode
   value 0x003B):

      1) The value of the "alias" property if the entry is a primitive
         type (primitive types are described in section 3.2).

      2) The value of the "alias-list" property if the entry is an
         envelope type.

   That is, the recursive list of contained aliases will be flattened
   into a single, top-level list.

3.1.1. Encrypted.

      #define GKR_TYPE_ENCRYPTED 0

   Encrypted enveloped types transform their enclosed types with a
   strong block cipher and an external key (for encipherment based on a
   password, see Section 3.1.2). The form of the key and the IV is not
   handled in this document; it is imagined as coming from a device that
   ensures secure production of a given array of bytes.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_ENCRYPTED
      eos                 Properties.
      uint8               Encryption algorithm identifier.
      eos                 Encrypted data.

   The encrypted data field is the encoded contained packets encrypted
   with the cipher.

   The cipher algorithms are:

      #define GKR_CIPHER_AES_128_OFB 0
      #define GKR_CIPHER_AES_128_CBC 1

   ‘GKR_CIPHER_AES_128_OFB’ denotes the AES cipher with a 128-bit key in
   output feedback mode, with 128-bit blocks. ‘GKR_CIPHER_AES_128_CBC’
   denotes the AES cipher with a 128-bit key in cipher block chaining
   mode.

   The padding for these ciphers shall be the same as that in [PKCS7].
   That is, if the plaintext is L bytes long, the padding will be

      01             if (L % 16) == 1
      02 02          if (L % 16) == 2
       ...
      16 16 ... 16   if (L % 16) == 0




draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 6]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   The AES is described in [AES].

   This type of envelope is OPTIONAL in conformant applications. It is
   included for completeness in the specification, and MAY be used in
   applications where password-based encryption is not appropriate.
   Implementations that cannot or do not want to use this type of
   ‘‘raw’’ encryption MUST still be able to parse these packets, but
   their contents may be discarded or ignored.

3.1.2. Password-Encrypted.

      #define GKR_TYPE_PBE 1

   Password-encrypted enveloped types use a combination of a password
   key-derivation function and a block cipher.

   The key derivation function is always KDF2 as described in [RFC2898]
   with HMAC-SHA-1 as the PRF, and the iteration count will fixed at
   1000.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_PBE
      eos                 Properties.
      byte[8]             Salt.
      uint8               Encryption algorithm identifier.
      eos                 Encrypted data.

   The cipher definitions are the same as in ‘GKR_TYPE_ENCRYPTED’,
   except the key and the IV are generated with the KDF, using a
   password read by the application, the salt, and the iteration count.

   Conformant applications MUST be able to parse password encrypted
   envelopes, and it is the default mode of protection.

   The password is typically read as a string input by a human operator;
   to process the password as bytes for input to the PRF, we use the
   UTF-8 encoding scheme. Thus a key and IV is derived from the
   password, salt, and iteration count with:

      (dk,iv) = PBKDF2 (UTF8(password), salt, 1000, 32)

   The length of the derived key for the AES ciphers defined here is 16
   bytes, and the IV is also 16 bytes long.

3.1.3. Authenticated.

      #define GKR_TYPE_MAC 2

   Authenticated enveloped types run a keyed message authentication code



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 7]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   over their enclosed types, appending the hash to the end of the
   packet. As with the encryption types described earlier, this form is
   meant to be of generic use, and applications will likely use the
   password-based alternative described in the next section.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_MAC
      eos                 Properties.
      uint8               Hash-based MAC identifier.
      eos                 Authenticated data.

   The authenticated data field is structured as follows:

      byte[n]             The to-be-authenticated data.
      byte[l]             The MAC of the preceding.

   The lengths of the two fields are context-dependent. The
   ‘GKR_HMAC_MD5_128’ produces a 16-byte MAC, so ‘l’ above would be 16
   for that algorithm. ‘n’ would be the total length of the field minus
   16.

   The currently defined MAC algorithms are:

      #define GKR_HMAC_MD5_128    0
      #define GKR_HMAC_SHA_160    1
      #define GKR_HMAC_MD5_96     2
      #define GKR_HMAC_SHA_96     3

   These MAC algorithms are hash-based MACs as described in [RFC2104],
   in combination with the MD5 [RFC1321] and SHA-1 [RFC3174] message
   digests. The *_96 variants are truncated to 96 bits.

   This type, like the ‘GKR_ENCRYPTED’ type, is OPTIONAL, and the same
   rules apply.

3.1.4. Password-Authenticated.

      #define GKR_TYPE_PBMAC 3

   Password-authenticated enveloped types use a password KDF in similar
   fashion as encrypted enveloped types, but with a keyed message
   authentication code.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_PBMAC
      eos                 Properties.
      byte[8]             Salt.
      uint8               Hash-based mac identifier.
      eos                 Authenticated data.




draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 8]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   The format of the authenticated data field and the supported
   algorithms is the same as ‘GKR_TYPE_MAC’.

   Conformant applications MUST be able to parse password authenticated
   envelopes, and it is the default mode of authentication.

   The MAC key is derived from the password in the same fashion as with
   password-encrypted types, and the length of the derived key shall be
   equal to the untruncated length of the HMAC’s hash function, so:

                             HMAC             dkLen
                        ================      =====
                        GKR_HMAC_MD5_128         16
                        GKR_HMAC_SHA_160         20
                        GKR_HMAC_MD5_96          16
                        GKR_HMAC_SHA_96          20

3.1.5. Compressed.

      #define GKR_TYPE_COMPRESSED 4

   Compressed envelope types compress their contents with a standard
   deflate algorithm.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_COMPRESSED
      eos                 Properties.
      uint8               Compression algorithm identifier.
      eos                 Compressed data.

   The following compression algorithms are supported:

      #define GKR_COMPRESS_DEFLATE 0

   The format of the encoded data is described in [RFC1951]. The
   compression is handled independently for each compressed envelope.

   Conforming implementations MUST be able to decompress DEFLATE-
   compressed envelopes.

3.1.6. Additional Envelope Types.

   GNU Keyrings may also contain the additional envelope type
   ‘GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY_SET’, but this type is not a generic envelope and
   is described in section 3.4.

3.2. Extension values.

   Values not defined in this document are reserved for future use. They



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                   [Page 9]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   MUST NOT appear in version 1 keyrings.

3.3. Primitive Types.

   Primitive types contain a single cryptographic entity. Primitive
   types MUST contain a property "alias", which MUST have a non-empty
   string that identifies the entry.

   Entries of different types MAY have the same alias, to allow for
   referring to public and private credentials by the same name.
   Entries of the name type in a keyring MUST have different aliases.

   Conforming implementations MUST be able to parse all primitive types
   described in this section.

3.3.1. Trusted Certificates.

      #define GKR_TYPE_CERT 5

   This value denotes a ‘‘trusted certificate entry’’.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_CERT
      eos                 Entry properties.
      uint64              Entry creation date.
      uint8               Encoding identifier.
      eos                 Encoded certificate.

   The following encoding identifier has been defined:

      #define GKR_CERT_X509_DER 0

   X.509 certificates must be stored as a raw DER sequence. The ASN.1
   structures for encoding X.509 certificates is described in [RFC3280].

   The creation date field, as used in this and all other primitive
   types, is the date this entry was created, measured in milliseconds
   since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

3.3.2. Public Keys.

      #define GKR_TYPE_PUBLIC_KEY 6

   This value denotes an asymmetric public key.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_PUBLIC_KEY
      eos                 Entry properties.

      eos                 Encoded key.

   The following encoding identifiers have been defined:

      #define GKR_PUBLIC_KEY_DSA_RAW  0
      #define GKR_PUBLIC_KEY_RSA_RAW  1
      #define GKR_PUBLIC_KEY_DH_RAW   2
      #define GKR_PUBLIC_KEY_X509_DER 3

   RSA, DSA, and DH keys are stored in the ‘‘RAW’’ codec used by GNU
   Crypto, which is described in Section 5.

   ‘GKR_KEY_X509_DER’ denotes keys stored in a DER-encoded
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 structure, as described in [RFC3280].

3.3.3. Private Keys.

      #define GKR_TYPE_PRIVATE_KEY 7

   This value denotes an asymmetric private key, or a symmetric secret
   key.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_PRIVATE_KEY
      eos                 Entry properties.
      uint64              Entry creation date.
      uint8               Encoding identifier.
      eos                 Encoded key.

   The following encoding identifiers have been defined:

      #define GKR_PRIVATE_KEY_DSA_RAW   0
      #define GKR_PRIVATE_KEY_RSA_RAW   1
      #define GKR_PRIVATE_KEY_DH_RAW    2
      #define GKR_PRIVATE_KEY_RAW       3
      #define GKR_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8_DER 4

   RSA, DSA, and DH keys are stored in the ‘‘RAW’’ codec used by GNU
   Crypto, which is described in Section 5.

   ‘GKR_PRIVATE_KEY_DH_RAW’ is stored as a raw octet sequence, and is
   not processed any further.

   ‘GKR_KEY_PKCS8_DER’ denotes keys stored in a DER-encoded
   PrivateKeyInfo ASN.1 structure, as described in [PKCS8].

3.3.4. X.509 Certificate Paths.

      #define GKR_TYPE_X509_PATH 8



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                  [Page 11]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   This value denotes an X.509 certificate path, which compliments a
   private key with the same alias name. Each private key should have a
   corresponding certificate chain, but this is not required by the
   format.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_X509_PATH
      eos                 Entry properties.
      uint64              Entry creation date.
      uint8               Chain encoding identifier.
      eos                 Encoded certificate chain.

   The following encodings are defined:

      #define GKR_X509_PATH_PKIX_DER  0

   ‘GKR_X509_PATH_PKIX_DER’ is merely stored as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE type
   of one or more certificates. The first certificate in the path must
   be the certificate corresponding to the private key, and each
   subsequent certificate MUST be the issuer of the preceding. The root
   certificate SHOULD NOT be included in this chain.

   The encoding used in PKCS #7 is not used here, for it does not
   preserve the order of certificates.

3.3.5. Additional Primitive Types.

   GNU Keyring files may also contain the primitive type
   ‘GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY’, but they may only appear in certain places and
   may only contain certain values, and is described in the next
   section.

3.4. Properties.

   Primary entry types (certificates and private keys) may also contain
   an optional properties list, which is nothing more than a series of
   (name, value) pairs. How these properties are interpreted is
   application-dependent, but some properties and their meanings will be
   defined in this document.

   Unsupported properties must not be cause for stopping the parsing of
   a keyring; properties are intended to give additional information
   about a particular entry, but they should not be considered crucial.

   There are, as of this writing, only two REQUIRED properties:

      "alias" -- this is a textual label that refers to the entry.  This
      property MUST appear in all primitive types, except for packets of
      type ‘GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY’.



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                  [Page 12]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


      "alias-list" -- this is a list of all aliases that an envelope
      type contains. This property MUST appear in all envelope types,
      except for packets of type ‘GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY_SET’.

3.4.1. Property Set.

      #define GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY_SET 9

   This is an additional envelope type that must only contain packets of
   the GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY type, and, naturally, does not contain a
   properties field.

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY_SET
      eos                 One or more GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY packets.

3.4.2. Property Type.

      #define GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY 10

      uint8               GKR_TYPE_PROPERTY
      u8string            Property name.
      u8string            Property value.

4. Required Layouts.

   The layout for keyrings that contain trusted certificates (ring usage
   bit 2) is as follows:

      (GKR_TYPE_PBMAC
        (GKR_TYPE_COMPRESSED
          (... zero or more certificates and public keys.)
        )
      )

   The layout for keyrings that contain private keys and personal public
   credentials (ring usage bits 0 and 1) is as follows:

      (GKR_TYPE_PBMAC
        (GKR_TYPE_COMPRESSED
          (... zero or more private keys, public keys, or certificate
           chains.)
        )
      )

   Furthermore, entries of type ‘GKR_TYPE_PRIVATE_KEY’ must be encoded
   as follows:

      (GKR_TYPE_PBMAC



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                  [Page 13]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


        (GKR_TYPE_PBE
          (GKR_TYPE_PRIVATE_KEY)
        )
      )

   Above, we usually assume that the MAC and encipherment use the same
   password, but different salts. Implementations are not required to
   handle encrypted and MAC’d packets with different passwords or keys,
   but they are not forbidden.

   In these constructions the password-based entries may be replaced by
   their raw-key variants.

4.1. Read-only Layouts.

   Constrained clients that need to be able to read trusted certificates
   (such as, for example, a ‘cacerts’ keyring for keeping a static set
   of certificate authority certificates), but do not necessarily need
   to read personal keyrings or add new certificates. In this case, it
   is sufficient to be able to read only keyrings with usage bit 2 set.

5. GNU Raw Codec

   The primary encoding format of public and private keys in GNU
   Keyrings is the ‘‘RAW’’ codec used by GNU Crypto.

5.1. DSA

   DSA public keys are encoded as:

      uint32              The value 0x47014450.
      uint8               Version, currently 1.
      bigint              p
      bigint              q
      bigint              g
      bigint              y

   And private keys as:

      uint32              The value 0x47014470.
      uint8               Version, currently 1.
      bigint              p
      bigint              q
      bigint              g
      bigint              x

5.2. RSA




draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                  [Page 14]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   RSA public keys are encoded as:

      uint32              The value 0x47015250.
      uint8               Version, currently 1.
      bigint              Modulus.
      bigint              Public exponent.

   And private keys as:

      uint32              The value 0x47015270.
      uint8               Version, currently 1.
      bigint              The prime p.
      bigint              The prime q.
      bigint              The public exponent e.
      bigint              The private exponent d.

5.3. Diffie-Hellmann

   Diffie-Hellman public keys are encoded as:

      uint32              The value 0x47014850.
      uint8               Version, currently 1.
      bigint              The prime modulus p.
      bigint              The generator g.
      bigint              The public value y.

   And private keys as:

      uint32              The value 0x47014870.
      uint8               Version, currently 1.
      bigint              The prime divisor of p-1.
      bigint              The prime modulus p.
      bigint              The generator g.
      bigint              The private exponent x.

6. Parsing Methodology.

   This format has been structured such that it is almost able to be
   parsed in one-pass; the only limit on this is for private keys that
   are contained in an MAC-then-encrypted envelope, when the key needed
   to decrypt and authenticate the packet may not be immediately
   available. Keyrings that only contain trusted certificates do not
   have this restriction, and can be parsed in a single pass.

   This limitation is imposed by the API of the java.security.KeyStore
   class, where a password is supplied to load the keystore from its
   external representation, and a password is supplied to retrieve a
   private key. Applications that do not need to adhere to this API can,



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                  [Page 15]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   of course, obtain both required passwords and therefore parse
   personal keyrings in one pass.

   While the KeyStore API allows access to both trusted and personal
   credentials, the separation of these two in GNU keyrings (via the two
   REQUIRED ring usage types) obviates this; that is, one can access
   trusted credentials, or one can access personal credentials, but not
   both, at least not from the same file. There are few, if any,
   standard Java APIs that require the access of both types of data from
   a single file, so this requirement should not break any applications.

7. Other Formats.

   The need for a new file format for the storage of cryptographic data
   is not immediately apparent; there are, for example, a number of
   formats already being used as ‘‘keystores’’ in Java environments.
   Common formats include the JKS (Java Key Store), PKCS #12, and JCEKS
   (Java Cryptography Extension Key Store).

   JKS and JCEKS are proprietary, and should be avoided in favor of open
   standards.

   PKCS #12 [PKCS12] is an open standard, but is rather too complicated
   and badly designed. The format is basically the BER (basic encoding
   rules) of a group of ASN.1 (abstract syntax notation one) structures.
   BER as a transport format makes little sense; if the data types are
   well-defined enough (as the ones in this document are) then the
   simple rules of reading and writing such as described in this
   document should suffice.

   A compelling argument against PKCS #12 is found in [DESIGN].

Security Concerns.

   As the primary goal of this format is to preserve the integrity of
   sensitive cryptographic data, the methods with which these data are
   protected must be cryptographically secure, and the way in which they
   are used in this format must not weaken or undermine the security of
   the algorithms used.

   The recommended encryption/MAC scheme is the ‘‘encrypt then MAC’’
   scheme, which is believed to be secure and has not shown the
   weaknesses found in alternative schemes, as [ORDER] points out.

   The AES, MACs based on MD5 and SHA, and KDF2 are currently accepted
   as secure, and as such we also assume that the most efficient way to
   forge or steal data from a GNU Keyring is a brute-force search of
   possible passwords, since we see no reason to believe that our usage



draft-marshall-gnu-keyring-00                                  [Page 16]

Marshall               The GNU Keyring File Format        September 2003


   of these algorithms here weakens them unduly. It is possible, though
   unlikely, that our introduction of unenciphered data before
   enciphered data in the MAC-then-encrypt structure (such as that
   defined in section 4) can weaken the MAC, we believe that there is no
   evidence that this enables an attack.

   It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that applications enforce restrictions on
   the length and content of passwords, and recommend that passwords be
   at least eight characters long and contain at least one digit and one
   non-alphanumeric character.
